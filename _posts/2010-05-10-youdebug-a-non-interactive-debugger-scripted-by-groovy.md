<p>YouDebug is an interesting approach to the problem of analyzing bugs that happen in a production environment. Instead of trying to reproduce the bug in a lab, YouDebug allows to write a groovy script that can set breakpoints and work with the state at the breakpoint, gathering data to find out the source of the bug.&nbsp;</p>
