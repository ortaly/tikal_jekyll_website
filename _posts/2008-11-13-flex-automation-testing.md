<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intro</span></p><p>I had the chance to straggle with Flex automation testing and Mercury <span class="unmark">QTP</span> tool here it comes...</p><div style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><div style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><div style="font-family: verdana,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Flex automation testing is an <span class="unmark">OOTB</span> feature, you can easily test your application all you have to do is to follow a simple installation process and you are good to go.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_3:Release_Notes#Installing_and_Configuring_Flex_Automated_Testing">http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Flex_3:Release_Notes#Installing_and_Configuring_Flex_Automated_Testing</a> <br />See also attached <span class="unmark">PDFs</span> for further knowledge about flex automation and <span class="unmark">QTP</span>.<br /><br />First tip: follow the installation instructions carefully and don't miss any step.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automation tool</span><br />I had to test my Flex application (customer is always right :) the first thing I did was to look for a working example, I found this example: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/flex_store_v2/">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/flex_store_v2/</a><br /><span class="unmark">Ok</span> so I can see a Flex application (:o) but what can I do with it? <br />In order to actually Record and Play Flex application actions we have to use an automation tool. There are commercial tools like Mercury <span class="unmark">QTP</span> (you can find maybe one or two in additional but not at the same level) or you can write a custom agent (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/custom_automated/">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/samples/custom_automated/</a>) which can be splendid but taking it to high level is not a trivial task.<br /><br />But what do you do if you need an open source tool? <br />After a little research I found the closet answer to <span class="unmark">QTP</span>, meet <span class="unmark">FunFx</span> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://funfx.rubyforge.org/">http://funfx.rubyforge.org/</a>)<br /><span class="unmark">FunFX</span> <font style="font-size: 10pt;">A Ruby tool for functional testing of Adobe Flex applications</font> 		 		<br /> 		 		<p><span class="unmark">FunFX</span> is the only <font style="font-weight: bold;">free</font><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>alternative to achieve functional testing of Adobe Flex applications.</p><p>See the user guide movie, awesome start (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://funfx.rubyforge.org/user-guide.html">http://funfx.rubyforge.org/user-guide.html</a>)</p><p>I have played with it a bit, it's nothing like <span class="unmark">QTP</span> which is much powerful but it's a good tool for basic testing and it probably will get better since it's still on a minor version.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Component <span class="unmark">API</span></span></p>After playing around with <span class="unmark">QTP</span> and <span class="unmark">FunFX</span> automation tools I went back and started to make my flex application testable. As I already figured out flex components already have its automation implemented (see <span class="unmark">IAutomationManager</span>), it means that if you have compiled your application with the automation testing libraries all you have to do is using the tool and it'll record and play your actions.<br /><br />To be continued....<br />Next some unpleasant surprises.<br />&nbsp;</div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>
