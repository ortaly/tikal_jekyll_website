<p>Sonar enables you to collect, analyze and report metrics on source code.</p>
<p>Sonar not only offers consolidated reporting on and across projects throughout time, but it becomes the central place to manage code quality.</p>
<p>Sonar currently covers Java and PL/SQL languages. However, Sonar is highly extensible and can therefore embark plugins to  cover new languages.</p>

<p>Very simple to install: http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Install+Sonar</p>
<p>and use:</p>

<p>There is also Hudson plugin that makes it even simplier to run sonar on the build server: http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Sonar+plugin</p>
