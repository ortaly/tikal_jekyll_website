<p>I am writing Grails application and using Acegi plugin for grails application.</p>
<p>Acegi security seems to be determined to create SQL statement using &quot;username&quot; as a name of the field responsible for a username. In addition Acegi adds a few more &quot;predefined&quot; fields.</p>
<p>How can i specify different name for a username field ? and other fields ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
