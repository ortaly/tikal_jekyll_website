Hey gang, Seems AdobeTM is offering Flex Builder 3 serial owners an option to extend their beta serial for Flash Builder 4. All you have to do is go here and provide your personal details and your FB3 serial. You will receive an email with your new Beta Extension Serial Number! Way cool!<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=flexblackbelt.wordpress.com&blog=5633522&post=125&subd=flexblackbelt&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />
