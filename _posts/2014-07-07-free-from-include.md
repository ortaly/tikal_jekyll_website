<p>New blog post!</p>

<p>Excerpt:</p>

<p>If you ever took part in any serious JS&nbsp;development in general and AngularJS specifically, you know that every time you create a new js file, you need to manually include a reference to it in the index.html file, other wise it won&rsquo;t be included and the app will fail.</p>

<p>How would you feel about not having to do that?</p>
