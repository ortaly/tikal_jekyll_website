<p>Tikal's Python group is delighted to host this month meetup of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyweb-il">PyWeb-IL</a> - one of the most active developers communities in Israel, with over 150 registered members, meeting regularly every month. The meetup will take place in Tikal's offices on Aug-30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pyweb-il/web/pyweb-18">agenda</a> contains lectures on client-side techniques &amp; best-practices (CSS, JavaScript &amp; HTML5), Django best practices (class-based views) &amp; Django-based open-source projects (Ekkli). After the meetup, a Django tutorial session will be offered to anyone interested.</p>
