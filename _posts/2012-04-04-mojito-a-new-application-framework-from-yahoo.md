<p>Mojito is a new javascript application framework from Yahoo. It supports writing modules (mojits)&nbsp;that run either on the client or the server, thus fusing client side and server side development. Other interesting features are the ability to bind html snippets to modules via mustache templating, integration with YQL to easily query remote services, YUI&nbsp;integration, events and i18n support. </p>
