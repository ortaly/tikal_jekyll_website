<p>&nbsp;In the last conference of the Israeli Internet Association, there was a day-long Django workshop by one of its founders - <a href="http://jacobian.org">Jacob Kaplan-Moss</a>. It was intended for people new to Python &amp; Django &amp; I highly recommend it for anyone wishing to start learning Django.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the full&nbsp;<a href="http://www.isoc.org.il/conf2011/sessions.php?session_id=11">video of the workshop</a>&nbsp;(slides are also available under each video).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
