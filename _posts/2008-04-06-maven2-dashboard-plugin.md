<p><span id="thmr_42" class="thmr_call"><span id="thmr_6" class="thmr_call">The Maven 1.x dashboard is such a tool. The Maven site is integrated into our continuous integration process, and the dashboard that is generated provides a birds-eye view of a lot of our quality metrics. This is especially useful when dealing with multi-module projects. For the Maven2 build system a similar plugin is currently available on <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/dashboard-maven-plugin">Codehaus</a>. However this plugin is not final yet and in the past we had some trouble to get it to work. Therefore we decided to try and build our own plugin. </span></span></p>
