<p>After having deal with popular IoC container for .NET  <a href="http://ninject.org/" target="_blank">Ninject</a>&nbsp; I was wandered about alternatives.</p>
<p>And I found two more: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html">Windsor</a> - &quot;<b>Castle Windsor</b> aggregates the <b>MicroKernel</b>   and exposes a powerful configuration support. It is    suitable for common enterprise application needs. It is able    to register facilities and components based on the configuration   and adds support for interceptors.&quot;. </p>
<p>Looks like most popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <a target="_blank" href="http://code.google.com/p/autofac/">autofac</a> - &quot;Autofac was designed with modern .NET features and <i>obsessive</i> object-orientation in mind. It will change the way you approach dependency injection in .NET.&quot;. </p>
<p>Young but powerfull proiject.</p>
