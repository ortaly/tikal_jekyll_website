<p>When I started to work with Eclipse a while ago, after years of working with Visual Studio and Netbeans, it took me some time to get use to work with it. Now that I'm back to Visual Studio, I found that I miss several features I had when I worked with Eclipse. Features that I miss can be categorized as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Text Editor - e.g. handle string value when entering a line break, etc.</li>
    <li>Navigation - sync the project tree with the source I edit, easily navigate between types and resources, and much more...</li>
    <li>Refactoring &nbsp;- meaning advanced refactoring - other than the basic default refactoring options given by the default installation of VS 2008.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--break-->
<p>Some of these features (if not all) exist in Netbeans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visual Studio 2010 was improved so it supports some of these features. It is expected to be released in Q1 2010. In the meanwhile, here are some add-ons for VS 2008 I installed to ease the pain ;-)</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands">Power Commands</a></li>

</ol>
