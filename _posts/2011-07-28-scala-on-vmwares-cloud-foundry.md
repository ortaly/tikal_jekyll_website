<p>&quot;VMWare announced <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com/" class="ext">Cloud Foundry</a>(TM)  support for Scala in June at Scaladays 2011. During a recent interview  Ramnivas Laddad, Senior Software Engineer at VMWare said &quot;Scala reduces  the barrier between idea and application. Cloud Foundry reduces the  barrier between application and scalable deployment.&quot; You can learn more  about this exciting open source project in this interview with Ramnivas  and Dekel Tankel, Cloud Foundry Product Marketing at VMWare.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the interview they share their (positive) experience with Scala and the reasons that led them to support it in Cloud Foundry as well as use it internally at VMWare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another interesting quote is this:</p>
<p>&quot;We are now looking to support Spring Applications with Scala DSLs,  specifically in Spring Integration, things like routers and  configuration. It will make the whole thing a lot easier to understand.&quot;</p>
