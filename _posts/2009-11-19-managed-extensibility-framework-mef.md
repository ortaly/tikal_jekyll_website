<p>In yesterday session &quot;What's new in CLR 4.0&quot; Microsoft guys presented new <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MEF">Managed Extensibility Framework</a>.</p>
<p>Which is going to be a part of .NET 4.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Application requirements change frequently and software is constantly evolving. As a result, such applications often become monolithic making it difficult to add new functionality. The Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) is a new library in .NET Framework 4.0 that addresses this problem by simplifying the design of extensible applications and components.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course they introduce it as totally new apporoach to development and architecture, but in my opinion it is yet another dependency injection framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case it is nice to see it as builtin part of .NET 4.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to MEF!.</p>
