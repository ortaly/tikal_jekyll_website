<p>I have an application with a set of model classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to externalize them with soap. I do not want to couple my soap interface with my internal classes, but on the other hand i do not want to duplicate all my classes (there are many).</p>
<p>Does any one have ideas of what to do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
