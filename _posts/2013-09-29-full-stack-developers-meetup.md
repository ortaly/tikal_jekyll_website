We meet monthly, on the last Tuesday of each month.

<p><span style="color: rgb(85, 85, 85); font-family: verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16.796875px;">We focus on a &quot;Full Stack&quot; developers, as for today every developer is expected to do a bit of everything: front-end, back-end, database/store, infrastructure and server operation, sure we all have a preference and specialization, but in order to keep up in the current technology pace we should learn and practice with more languages, technologies, libraries and platforms, not to mention to be able to plan, architect, develop, deploy and maintain an entire application and the stack it runs on by yourself.</span></p>
