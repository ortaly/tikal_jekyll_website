<p><strong>The Java RIA Framework</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.jspresso.org/">Jspresso</a> is an innovative framework for building <strong>rich internet applications</strong>. Jspresso <strong>dramatically reduces the development cycles</strong> needed to get your corporate application up and running while not sacrificing <strong>quality, robustness and performance</strong>. Jspresso is <strong>not just another webapp framework</strong>. Jspresso based applications offer the exact same ergonomics as desktop applications while keeping an <strong>N-tier, server-centric architecture</strong> on a java backend. Jspresso-based applications can be deployed either in <strong>Adobe's Flex, Ajax (WingS), ULC and Swing, all on the same codebase and without a single specific line of GUI code</strong>. And last but not least, Jspresso is <strong>free</strong>.</p>
