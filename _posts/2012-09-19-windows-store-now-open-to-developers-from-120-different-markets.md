<p>The Windows Store blog announced today that the store is now open to a massive number of developers, from across 120 different markets. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsstore/archive/2012/09/11/windows-store-now-open-to-all-developers.aspx" target="_blank">From their post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Today’s an especially great day to be a developer. We’re very excited to announce the last significant milestone in the rollout of the Windows Store before the general availability of Windows 8 on October 26. The Store is now open for app submissions from all developers – individuals and companies – in our supported markets, and we’ve added 82 more app submission markets! Now, developers from </em><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh694064.aspx#account_countries">120 markets</a><em></em><em> can publish Windows Store apps.</em></p>
