<p>Earlier this month MS released Silverlight V3. It contains many many improvements over V2. You can read all about it in <a target="_blank" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/07/10/silverlight-3-released.aspx">Scott Guthrie's blog</a>. Personally I find the opportunity to run Silverlight as a desktop application appealing. If the technology will be able to proudly &quot;hold&quot; small to medium desktop applications, this will promote this technology several steps ahead.</p>
