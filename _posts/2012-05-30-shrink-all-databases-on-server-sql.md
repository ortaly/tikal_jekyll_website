<p>About a month ago, I got a call from a client of mine saying he has 2 database servers, each holding about 150 databases.</p>

<p>The servers were both SQL Server 2008, he had 2 HDâ€™s with 74GB each and there was absolutely no space on any of them.</p>

<p>After a short research I found that the backup files were absolutely huge and fill the disk up to a point that the server had no space to store any more data and the website connected to that database crashed.</p>

<p>Without going too much into details why these things happen (bad programming) I will give you a method to fix this.</p>

<p>It is recommended to backup your databases to an external HD before doing this, this way you will have the full backup at all times. <!--more--></p>

<p>Simply run this script, your databases (all of them) will shrink the log file, creating more room on the HD for you to use.</p>

<p>Good luck</p>
