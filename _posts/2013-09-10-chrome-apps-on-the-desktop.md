<p>Finally, the long awaited chrome packaged apps feature that the chrome team has been working, has been released.</p>
<p>This project aims to bring the distribution of web apps to a cross-platform desktop app experience (Mac &amp; Linux are coming soon). Apps run in their own sandboxed web (chrome) container wraped in the platform&#39;s gui.</p>
<p>Finally, Chrome apps are launched with &quot;chrome launcher&quot; application and gives access to any application that is installed through chrome store.</p>
