<p>In <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2009/06/03/red-hat-reacts-to-springsources-leadership/">this blogpost</a>, Rod Johnson, SpringSource's chief, who has been using the blogging as a mass-media means from its early days, talks about the differences between the business approaches of SpringSource and RedHat, which seem to have taken JBoss's assertive approach regarding Spring and the future of enterprise development. Very interesting, although quite biased!</p>
