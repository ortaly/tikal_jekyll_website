<p>Faceted browsing is popular in shopping or price comparison sites (e.g. zap.co.il) which allow you to narrow the list of products by selecting a feature from several types of features.</p><p>Seek does the same for thunderbird messages, allowing you to quickly find messages.</p><p>One of the downsides is that it always re-indexes the folder whenever you switch to another and come back</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
