<p>BTrace is a safe, dynamic tracing tool for the Java platform. BTrace can be used to dynamically trace a running  Java program (similar to <b><a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/dtrace/">DTrace for OpenSolaris</a></b> applications  and OS).  BTrace dynamically instruments the classes of the target application to inject tracing code  (&quot;bytecode tracing&quot;).  Tracing code is expressed in Java programming language. There is also integration with   DTrace for the OpenSolaris platform.</p>
