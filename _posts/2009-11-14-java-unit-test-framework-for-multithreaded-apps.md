<p><a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/10/testing-race-conditions-in-java.html">Thread Weaver</a>&nbsp;is a test framework that gives a control over thread execution, which is important if you want to test race conditions and such. I haven't tried it, it it looks nice from the &quot;outside&quot; - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/thread-weaver/wiki/UsersGuide">here is their wiki</a>. Will be glad to get a feedback from users.</p>
