<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dinnernow.net/">DinnerNow</a> is a sample application intended to demonstrate good practices in building &ldquo;connected&rdquo; applications based on .NET technologies. It supports IIS7, <a target="_blank" href="http://asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> Ajax Extensions,  		LINQ, Windows Communication Foundation, Windows Workflow Foundation, Windows  		Presentation Foundation, Windows PowerShell, and the .NET Compact Framework. 		<br />
<br />
The project created and maintained by <span><a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/habibh/archive/2009/07/04/dinnernow-net-3-0-for-visual-studio-2008-sp1-and-net-framework-3-5-sp1-is-here.aspx">Habib Heydarian</a>, program manager, Visual Studio Debugger.</span><br />
<br />
Earlier this month a new version was released, including bug fixes and improvements, the most important IMHO is the support SP1 of both Visual Studio 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5. Before installing and trying it, don't forget to go over the supported platforms, which can be found <a href="http://dinnernow.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>. I was able to fix it so it can be somehow used on Win XP SP 3, but a small part of it relies on IIS 7 and its Handlers.<br />

The project can be also downloaded from <a target="_blank" href="http://dinnernow.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a>.</p>
