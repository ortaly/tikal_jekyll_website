<p>As a part of the product codebase at VMWare, we've recently included  classes that were autogenerated from a WSDL (web services descriptor)  and are used to access that web service from java.<br />
As a result, the hudson build fails due to code duplication. Since this code is autogenerated, we don't really mind that.<br />
How can we configure Hudson to skip code duplication test for these specific packages?<br />
