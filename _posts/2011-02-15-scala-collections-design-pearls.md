<p>Attached a presentation I&nbsp;gave at a client about some design pearls from the Scala collection library that show some advanced features of Scala:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Use of functions for iteration</li>
    <li>Usage of builders so that filter and map can return the same type as they were invoked in, or one that is applicable</li>
    <li>Exitential types</li>
    <li>Type constructors</li>
    <li>Views and iterators</li>
    <li>Type classes</li>
    <li>Manifests</li>
    <li>Generalized type constraints</li>
    <li>How strings and native arrays also have all methods of the collection hierarchy</li>
    <li>Streams</li>
</ul>
