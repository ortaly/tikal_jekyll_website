No more sexy will be seen in Utah<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;p&gt;Laws aimed at governing human sexual behavior always seem to produce conflict. This is no less true in the state of Utah, where a debatable anti-prostitution law amendment has people talking. The AP reports that two escort services have filed suit against the state as the wording of the law is so broad that it would make something as simple as <a href="http://www.newsytype.com/6577-utah-anti-prostition-law/">acting sexy</a> against the law. &lt;/p&gt;<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
<br />
Sex offerings illegal in Utah, even if they are implied<br />
<br />
</strong><br />
<br />
In order to help undercover agents attempting to stop the sex trade from occurring, an anti-prostitution legislation was put into place in Utah, according to the Salt Lake City Police Chief Chris Burbank. Since asking officers to &quot;expose or touch themselves&quot; is now against Utah legislation, it would not be allowed for prostitutes to ask law enforcement this to prove they are not law enforcement. While direct verbal solicitation of sex for money is outlawed, recent amendments to Utah's sex laws also include &quot;lewd&quot; or &quot;suggestive&quot; nonverbal acts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
According to Burbank, non-prostitutes will not be targeted with the legislation. It is simply to stop the sex trade from occurring, specifically when under-aged parties are involved.<br />

Officers were being put in a position that we're not going to allow, so we took a different direction,&quot; he told the AP.<br />

Problem with acting sexy in Utah<br />
<br />

The escort service will be represented by attorney Andrew McCullough in the lawsuit. He is worried that some of the other businesses with sexual components will be in legal trouble. Escort services and strip club dancers who traditionally express their sexuality or &quot;act sexy&quot; as parts of the job are not necessarily soliciting sexual contact, argues McCullough.<br />

<br />
&quot;Most girls who touch their breasts are not telling you they're open for sex,&quot; the attorney said.<br />

Massachusetts bill<br />
</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
If parents are in the process of divorce, it would be illegal for them to have intercourse at home in Massachusetts with a bill being considered. The idea is to protect children and slow domestic violence, according to Wrentham, Mass., Selectman Robert Leclair. Critics claim the law wouldn't only rob parents of their rights, but also ban any sexual relationship within the home until the divorce is final, yet another example of broad wording.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The good news is the bill would stop lifetime alimony payments. A spouse would not have to pay too much to the other.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
And how about bestiality?<br />
<br />
</strong><br />
Not to be forgotten, proposed Florida Senate Bill 344 would ban bestiality. Sen. Nan Rich of Sunrise, Fla., who first introduced the bill in 2009, believes that such legislation is long overdue in the Sunshine State. Some say SB 344 needs to be reworded. It is pretty broad as well. SB 344 might be banning human sexual intercourse since the word &quot;animals&quot; in the phrase &quot;sex with animals&quot; might be referring to humans too, according to Escapist Magazine.<br />
