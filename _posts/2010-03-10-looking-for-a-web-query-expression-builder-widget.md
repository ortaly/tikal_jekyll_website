<p>I am looking for a web component that allows a simple user build a query (or at least an expression / function).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system have a known data schema, and the widget should allow the user to pick fields and to define an aritmetic formula based on those fileds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any recommendations? Does anyone know about a widget that can be used for that purpose?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Udi</p>
