<p><a href="http://www.gridshore.nl/2009/06/07/using-google-analytics-data-in-your-application/">Gridshore's excellent blog</a> demonstrates using google APIs to get access to <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> data. For those who don't know it, Google Analytics is a free service for monitoring usage patterns and statistics of web sites. By including a Javascript line in your site, you get various types of information starting from geographical data and the nutorious browser/os matrix, to success rates of your landing pages and drop ratio from predefined goal-oriented campaigns (predefined page flows). All this abundance of data is available through <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">the site</a>, of course, but can also be accessed programmaticaly using Google's service APIs. This can be quite handy, for example, for detecting SEO or programming bugs that lead to high drop rates, which, at the end of the day, leads to better cash flow and such. Great service, and interesting to read for every person who wants to promote her site.</p>
