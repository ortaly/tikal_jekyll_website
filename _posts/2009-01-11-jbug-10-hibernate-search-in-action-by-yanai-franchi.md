<p>Hibernate Search, an open source project under the Hibernate umbrella, is built on top of the extremely powerful Apache Lucene(tm) and aims to solve all those issues to bring Google(tm)-like search capability to ORM powered persistent domain models, while keeping the solution simple and flexible.
