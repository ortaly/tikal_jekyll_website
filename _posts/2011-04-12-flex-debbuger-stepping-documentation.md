<p>While working on the <a href="http://www.tikalk.com/flex/code-execution-viewer">code execution viewer</a>, we made contact with <a href="http://www.morearty.com/blog/about/">Mike Morearty</a>, who was the main developer on fdb and the Flash Builder debugger for a number of years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During our correspondanse, Mike shared a lot of detailed information regarding the internals of the Flex commandline debugger (fdb), which has no public documentation beyond the Javadoc comments in the fdb source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike just shared the <a href="http://www.morearty.com/blog/2011/04/10/fdb-the-flex-debugger-internals-of-how-stepping-works/">fdb internals of how stepping works </a>in his blog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He&nbsp;covers the following topics:<br />
- What is the command-line debugger for flex (fdb) and where can you find its source code.<br />
- How fdb interacts with the&nbsp; flash debug player.<br />
- How fdb stepping (step into, step over, step out) works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks to Mike for this !</p>
