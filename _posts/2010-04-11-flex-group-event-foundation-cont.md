<p>We will continue with the Flex Foundation.</p>
<p>I would like to discuss the following issues:</p>
<p><strong>Communication patterns </strong>- Can we offer built-n implementation to different communication patterns which re-occur in many applications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://swizframework.org/">SWIZ </a></strong>- Can we leverage this framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to start assign developement/design/research tasks..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Ilan</p>
