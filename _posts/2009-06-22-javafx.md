hi,

is anyone using javaFX?

i am thinking of using it for client application that should be available for mobile and desktop usage. it can not be browser, since it needs its own DB, and should be able to work offline.

I thought i can use either Java (and later port it to ME), or use JavaFX.

any thoughts?

another one was to use AIR, but it seems there is no way to port it to mobile, at least not for now. is this so? 

thanks,
Tami
