<p>So, a new language which compiles to Java bytecode is demonstrated here: <a href="http://cogitations.arbia.co.uk/post/3984477935/fun-java-with-mirah">http://cogitations.arbia.co.uk/post/3984477935/fun-java-with-mirah</a></p><br/>
<p>I liked the code samples. Syntax is better without those curly bracers invented in 70s. Template strings are also a big progress from the string concatenations or String.format with all those %f (another say hello to seventies).</p><br/>
<p>But it will be hard to promote a new language having only syntax difference from Java. People need a lot from programming language today. What about IDE support, for example?</p>
