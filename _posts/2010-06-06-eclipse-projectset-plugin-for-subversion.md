<p>For those of you that miss the eclipse projectset plugin we used to work with cvs, i finally found <a href="http://vpms.de.csc.com/projectset/">its latest version and the SVN adaptors</a> that works fine in the latest eclipse (Galileo).</p>
<p>Use update site of the plugin in version V3.0.0 from the Download page. Note that if you have older version installed, you have to uninstall it first.</p>
<p>Use links in the main page to install the adaptor. Subclipse adaptor works fine, the one for Subversive I didn't check.</p>

<p>Enjoy :)</p>
