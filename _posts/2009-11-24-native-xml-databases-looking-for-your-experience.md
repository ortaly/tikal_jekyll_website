<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm looking for your experience with xml db.</p>
<p>I'm looking for a XQuery based xml db, that can store large amount of data and that I can work with large xml files (let's say 2G) </p>
<p>Does anyone familiar with eXist DB? what about oracle berkeley? and others...</p>
<p>10x,</p>
<p>Keren</p>
