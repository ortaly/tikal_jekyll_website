<p>If you ever used C# then you know you cannot dismiss this language easily considering what it has to offer compared to other market languages. Yes, you can say it took the async model from Node.js and you can say it mimics Ruby’s Active Record pattern with ASP.NET MVC, you can also state that Visual Studio NuGet feature mimics eclipse in some weird way – but you cannot take the full richness of this language compared to any other.
<p>There are also many more features that does not exists in other languages and the best thing its get evolved in one of the fastest rates, almost every year there are many features complete.
<p>So it earned the rank of the <strong>No. 1 programming language of 2012</strong>, the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pydatalog/pypl/PyPL-PopularitY-of-Programming-Language">PYPL PopularitY of Programming Language index</a> revealed. It’s not because it’s the most popular, it’s because it has the biggest growth in 2012. While the popular <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBE</a> Index looks at Objective-C as a language of the year candidate, the PYPL index goes with C#.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The PYPL index is based on data from Google Trends, which measures search volume, and the results are based on the relative number of searches for programming tutorials in the given language. The PYPL index is created by analyzing how often language tutorials are searched on Google—the more a specific language tutorial is searched, the more popular the language is assumed to be. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_indicator#Leading_indicators">leading indicator</a>. And as the raw data comes from <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>, anyone can verify it, or make the analysis for their own country. (<a href="http://www.eweek.com/developer/c-named-top-programming-language-of-2012/">says eweek</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, according to the PYPL index, Java and JavaScript are fairly stable, the growth of C# comes at the expense of C and Basic, and the growth of Python is at the expense of Perl.
