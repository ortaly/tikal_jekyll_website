<p>&nbsp;I have a client that wanted to add the ability for the client to have an autocomplete of location names.</p>
<p>I started thinking of how to implement it and from where to get the information for the location names.</p>
<p>Then i came accross of the following service:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google Places Auto complete:&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/autocomplete">developers.google.com/places/documentation/autocomplete</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A blog that explians in details of how to use it can be found at:&nbsp;<a href="http://ddewaele.blogspot.co.il/2011/05/introducing-google-places-api.html">ddewaele.blogspot.co.il/2011/05/introducing-google-places-api.html</a></p>
