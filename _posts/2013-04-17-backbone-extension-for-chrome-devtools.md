<p>If you&#39;re developing with Backbone and uses Chrome Devtools to debug, this extension wil be helpful.</p>
<p>it creates a new tab in Chrome DevTools which will log any backbone Object creation and Events.</p>
<p>It also adds a new panel within the &quot;Elements&quot; section, which similar to the &quot;styles&quot; panel, will show the relevant JS Backbone View Instance attached to the currently selected DOM node.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forked this project to have <a href="https://github.com/orizens/backbone-devtools" target="_blank">dynamic support for Backbone projects that use AMD</a> (such as require.js) to load Backbone.js asynchronoly.</p>
<p>I recommend this extension for anyone who works with Backbone apps - it sheds some light and very helpful.</p>
