This graph might give you a hint. The graph displays the percentage of jobs found for each search terms on <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.indeed.com/jobanalytics/jobtrends?q=HTML5%2C+flex&l=">indeed.com</a>. According to this graph, demand for Flex developers is obviously taking a huge fall while demand for HTML5 is rising in an amazing rate.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3tKaG0exXiQ/T19HyVUxCgI/AAAAAAAAAS0/tuq1sVnsafQ/s1600/Screenshot.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3tKaG0exXiQ/T19HyVUxCgI/AAAAAAAAAS0/tuq1sVnsafQ/s400/Screenshot.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5719368981827095042" border="0" /></a><span style="font-size:85%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">source: </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.indeed.com/jobanalytics/jobtrends?q=HTML5%2C+flex&l=">Indeed.com</a></span><br /></div><br />I find two possible explanations to the graph, each one is also introducing a different forecast :<br /><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">[Pessimistic] Flex is vanishing from the industry</span>, in a couple of years it will no longer be used for new projects, Flex developers will still be able to find jobs maintaining existing projects, very much like developer of other technologies that have vanished form the job market.</li></ul><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">[Optimistic] The market is over reacting</span> to Adobe's recent Flex related strategy. Yes, some companies are avoiding the use of Flex for new projects and are exploring new technologies, but soon those companies will find out the obvious, HTML5\JS Are not mature enough and at this point can not offer companies a real alternative to Flex. Many of these companies will soon understand that leaving Flex was a mistake. They will get back to hiring Flex developers.</li></ul><p>Which one of these forecasts is the right one? we'll just have to wait and see.<br /></p>
