<div>I couldn&#39;t find all the release notes, as this looks very fresh, and it seems like they&#39;re still updating the docs (according to the activity on GH) as I&#39;m writing this, but as I could gather from looking at the new docs and site, this is some of what&#39;s new:</div>

<div>
<ul>
	<li style="margin-left: 15px;">New flat, simplified modern look and feel.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Simpler integration for the provided JS components.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Support for Zepto is dropped- only jQuery is supported now.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Better organized, revamped docs!</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 15px;">Looks like the off-canvas navigator was changed and it looks very easy to use now (I haven&#39;t tried it before).</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 15px;">New feature for grid- source ordering specification by different sizes.</li>
</ul>

<div>There could be a lot more, the release notes should probably be up soon.</div>
</div>

<div>There&#39;s a simple migration guide if you&#39;re interested:&nbsp;</div>
