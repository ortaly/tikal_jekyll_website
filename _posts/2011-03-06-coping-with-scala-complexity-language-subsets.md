<p>Scala is a powerful language (you can even make it looking like BASIC http://www.scala-lang.org/node/1403 ). Being so powerful, it's also complicated language, and at the beginning it may be hard to select the right way of doing things. To help with this, there will be 6 standard language subsets (3 levels for application developers and 3 levels for library developers).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So next time you are trying to use an implicit definition, ask yourself &quot;am I really an&nbsp;Expert library designer?&quot;</p>
