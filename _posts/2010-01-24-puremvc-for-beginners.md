<p>If you're a beginner, another good resource is the demo project which gives you a taste of the framework core actors</p>

<p><span class="postcolor">When I first started learning the basics of PureMVC it was hard for me to find good videos on the subject</span>.</p>
<p><span class="postcolor">The Videos on Puremvc.tv where a good overview, but I found (after a lot of digging) something better and longer<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Tip: first play with the sample project, and then see the video lecture,</p>
<p>it will make more sense after you'll have some questions regarding the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.s.</p>
<p>The pureMvc forums have every answer to every question I've had, requires time but you'll get the answers you need</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have fun,</p>
