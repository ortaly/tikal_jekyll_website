<h3>What is Event Controller?</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially Event Controller is an easier way to keep track of events in actionscript 3. Event Controller is a simple extension to your normal workflow that allows you to easily tag, group and remove any and all events. Its designed to stay out of your way and follow nearly the same structure as you are already using for creating and removing events with AS3. Only now with a little extra horsepower under the hood.</p>
