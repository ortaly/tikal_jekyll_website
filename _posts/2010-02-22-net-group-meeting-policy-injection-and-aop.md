<p>On our previous session we looked at a few frameworks for the dependency injection in .Net. While dependency injection takes the burden of wiring out of the business logics code, it still requires a lot of work for defining the dependencies between all the components again and again. In this session we will learn about Policy Injection and AOP in .Net. These techniques allow us to introduce a cross-cutting &quot;aspects&quot; into our code in much less lines of code or lines of configuration. Presenter - Michael Lvov.&nbsp;</p>
