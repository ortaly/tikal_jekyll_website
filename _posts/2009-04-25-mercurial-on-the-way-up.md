<p>Mercurial (or Hg) is a distributed version control system, similar to git. I used it many times on local file system to track changes while they are not ready to commit to clients repository. Google code decided to support, and published an insteresting analysis: http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/DVCSAnalysis</p>
