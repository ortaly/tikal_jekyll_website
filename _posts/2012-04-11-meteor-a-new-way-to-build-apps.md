<p>Meteor is a new javascript web application framework that handles both client side and server side development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some interesting features (from http://www.meteor.com/screencast):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Live updating of DOM - you change the data and the dom is automatically updated</li>
    <li>Automatic sync between clients - you change the data and it is pushed to all clients</li>
    <li>Code changes push - update the code and the clients start using it</li>
    <li>Work with the backend databse in the client, in sync - write queries or inserts that go to the server and return with the results (and update the DOM)</li>
    <li>Async change handling - change&nbsp; the data and locally the view is automatically changed without waiting for the change to go to the server and get a query result back.</li>
</ul>
