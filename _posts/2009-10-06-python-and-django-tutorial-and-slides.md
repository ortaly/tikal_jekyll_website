<p>&nbsp;I've written a tutorial on &quot;<strong>Building an Enterprise Information System using Django</strong>&quot; (see file attachments below), intended for both executives &amp; developers. Based on it I gave a talk at Verint Systems, summarizing the main ideas (slides also attached).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW,&nbsp;there are hands-on training sessions planned (1 scheduled for next week), to which you're all invited. I'll be posting the details here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy..</p>
