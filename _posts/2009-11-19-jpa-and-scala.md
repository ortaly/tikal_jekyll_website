<p>Using JPA with Scala is problematic, as this article describes: http://www.hars.de/2009/03/jpa-with-scala.html</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main obstacle is that Scala 2.7.x does not support nested annotations. This has been fixed in 2.8 trunk several months ago, but 2.8 is still not released. </p>
