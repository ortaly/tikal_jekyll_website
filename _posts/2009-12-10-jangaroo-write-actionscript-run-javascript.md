<p>jangaroo provides an actionscript to javascript compiler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the site:</p>
<p>So far, JavaScript projects had to rely on proprietary runtime extensions to conveniently build classes, inherit from a superclass, do a super call and so on. There was no tool support for these extensions. <a target="_blank" href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/specs/actionscript/3/as3_specification.html">ActionScript 3</a> can do better, but it is not available in every environment, or only through&nbsp;plug-ins.</p>
<p>We carefully selected ActionScript 3 <a href="http://www.jangaroo.net/home/1480/language.html">language features</a> that JavaScript 1.x developers need most desperately for <strong>Object-Oriented Programming &quot;in the large&quot;</strong> to form the Jangaroo language. Because the Jangaroo language is a subset of AS3, it profits from <strong>third party tool support</strong>, like Flex's documentation tool <strong>asdoc</strong> or JetBrains' fantastic IDE <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>.</p>
