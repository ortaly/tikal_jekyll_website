<p>Bruce Eckel is known for his books &quot;Thinking in C++&quot; and &quot;Thinking in Java&quot;. In recent years he has focused on Python. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;If you've read my past writings, you know I am unimpressed with  arguments about static type checking for its own sake, which typically  come down to &quot;if I can't know X is an int, then the world will  collapse!&quot; I've written and seen enough robust code in Python to be  unswayed by such histrionics; the payoff for all the hoop-jumping in C++  and Java seems small compared to what can be accomplished using far  less, and much clearer, Python code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scala is the first language I've seen where static type-checking  seems to pay off. Some of its amazing contortional abilities would not, I  think, be possible without static type checking. And, as I shall  attempt to show in this article, the static checking is relatively  unobtrusive -- so much so that programming in Scala almost feels like  programming in a dynamic language like Python.&quot;</p>
