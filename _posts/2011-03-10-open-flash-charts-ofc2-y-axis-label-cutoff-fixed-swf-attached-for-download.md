<p>Recently we have developed a dashboard using <a href="http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/COM/Community+Dashboard+Framework">CDF</a> and <a href="http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart-2/">OFC2</a> and came across a bug with y-axis labels cutoff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bug was described here <a href="http://forums.openflashchart.com/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=1596">Y axis numbers are cut off above 1Mil</a></p>
<p>and solved here <a href="http://jasonrowe.com/2009/07/09/actionscript-data-loading/">Out of sync ActionScript Data&nbsp;Loading</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem was that the OFC team is not planning to fix the bug...</p>
<p>and that the version that was published <a href="http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?101174-CLOSED-2.1.x-Chart-YAxis-Labels-are-truncated-cut-off-for-numbers-gt-1000000&amp;s=7816517c76ea51039abfe52ba3b58e24">here</a> did not work for us..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we have fixed the code (OFC Version 2 Lug Wyrm Charmer) and recompile it, the .swf file is attached..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
