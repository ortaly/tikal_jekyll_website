<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SPDY&nbsp;is a google initiative to make serving web pages faster by fixing some of the flaws in HTTP. It adds a layer on top of TCP&nbsp;that allows several streams over one connection. HTTP&nbsp;then goes on top of it. </p>
<p><br />
Their experiments show a performance boost of up to 50%</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SPDY&nbsp;has been enabled in Chrome since Jan. 2011. Since it requires the server to be SPDY aware also, it only impacts when chrome connects to google's servers.</p>
