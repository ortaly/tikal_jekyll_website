<p>Author believe that main problem of anonymous inner classes is not their a somewhat limited semantic (yeah, they aren't real full blown closures!) but verbosity of declaration. While it is not difficult to write anonymous inner classes using completion and/or templates in java editor, reading of such structures can be really hurting.</p><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/lambda4jdt/">code.google.com/p/lambda4jdt/</a></p>
