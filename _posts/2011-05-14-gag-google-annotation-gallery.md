<p>&quot;The Google Annotations Gallery is an exciting new Java open source   library that provides a rich set of annotations for developers to   express themselves. Do you find the standard Java annotations dry and   lackluster? Have you ever resorted to leaving messages to fellow   developers with the <tt>@Deprecated</tt> annotation? Wouldn't you rather leave a <tt>@LOL</tt> or <tt>@Facepalm</tt> instead? If so, then this is the gallery for you.&quot;</p>
