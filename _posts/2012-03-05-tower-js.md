<p>i haven't decided what I think about <a href="http://towerjs.org/">Tower.js</a>, yet...&nbsp;</p>
<p>a RoR like framework for node.js (using CoffeeScript) that, as far as i'm concerned, misses the point a little bit.&nbsp;the lack of support for code-migration (sharing code between server and client) kinda ruins it for me... in terms of feature richness and implementation complexity (of the framework itself) Tower is one of the most advanced Node.js web-stacks/frameworks out there. will definitely give it a try!</p>
