<p>&nbsp;Hey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I got into native Android development.</p>
<p>While digging around for information, I stumbled upon this online course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a recording of 5 class sessions, each session is 4 recordings.</p>
<p>I am only half way through it but so far It is informative, extensive and all-round a good course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's only disadvantage is that it is a video recording so it's hard (read impossible) to skim through it as you would skim a book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, almost forgot the link :)</p>
