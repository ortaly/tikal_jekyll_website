<p>Flash media server has some disadvantages, one of those is definitely the lack of normal statistics. The terminal will give you the real time data but if you want to drill down into last month and 3 month ago or more, you won’t be able to get any data in a comfortable and nice view. <!--more--> I found a product called <a href='http://www.sawmill.net/' target='_blank'>SawMill</a>, this product is unobtrusive on your flash media server, you don’t even have to install it on your server.</p>

<p>So, how can you get Stats you ask?</p>

<p>Well, you simply install the product, you give it a path to your log files and it will do the rest, it has a built in support for the Flash Media Server log format so you don’t have to “teach” it how to read the logs or do any kind of configuration.</p>

<p>You have stats like: <ul>
	<li>Client Ip's</li>
	<li>Media files played</li>
	<li>amount of data streamed</li>
	<li>time of use</li>
	<li>pressure hours</li>
</ul> And many more of course, the real treat is that you can drill down from year to month to day to hourly stats.</p>

<p>Those can come in handy if you want to learn more about your website and the usage.</p>

<p>Example of what a stat sheet looks like:</p>
