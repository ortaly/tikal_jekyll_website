<p>Recently I wrote a new post in the blog, you&#39;re welcomed to come check it out.</p>

<p>excerpt:&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Every once in a while, I find myself in need of a timing mechanism. Something that will handle timing and scheduling, and allow me to hook with a custom functionality every interval.</em></p>

<p><em>Some uses can be, for example, a clock counting down or simply showing the time passing by, polling the server back-end for new data, etc. Basically, anything that needs to happen every given interval.</em></p>
