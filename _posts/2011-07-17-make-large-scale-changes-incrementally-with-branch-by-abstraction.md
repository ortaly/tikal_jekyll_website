<p>&quot;Many development teams are used to making heavy use of branches in  version control. Distributed version control systems make this even more  convenient. Thus one of the more controversial statements in <em>Continuous Delivery</em>  is that you can&rsquo;t do continuous integration and use branches. By  definition, if you have code sitting on a branch, it isn&rsquo;t integrated.  One common case when it seems obvious to use branches in version control  is when making a large-scale change to your application. However there  is an alternative to using branches: a technique called branch by  abstraction.&quot;</p>
