<p>I think enough was said about the XAML editor in all VS version to date (including 2012).
<p>Here is “<a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fmarguerie/archive/2009/01/29/life-changer-xaml-tip-for-visual-studio.aspx">a Life changing XAML tip for Visual Studio</a>” a friend sent me to keep the XAML editor fast as a lightning.
<p>From Fabrice’s weblog:<br />
<blockquote>
<p><b>use the “Source Code (Text) Editor”</b>. It doesn’t seem obvious based on its name, but this editor provides XAML IntelliSense, XML collapsing, and the XAML context menu.<br />To use this, it’s quite simple:
<ol>
<li><b>Right-click on a XAML file in the Solution Explorer</b>
<li><b>Select “Open With…”</b>
<li><b>Select “Source Code (Text) Editor”</b>
<li><b>Click on “Set as Default”</b>
<li><b>Click OK</b>
<li><b>You’re done!</b></li>
</ol>
<p>The cherry on the cake: If you want to use the default XAML editor (with its split view, navigator, etc.), you just have to select “View Designer” in the text editor’s context menu or use SHIFT+F7.</p>
