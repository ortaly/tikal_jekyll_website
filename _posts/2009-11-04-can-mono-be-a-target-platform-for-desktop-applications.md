<p>Mono is project I truly admire. Deploying a .NET WinForms application on non-Windows platform is really something I need. But can I really do that? One of the major incentives to move from the web to the desktop is to achieve a much better look and feel ( - I know, there are other very good reasons :-) )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In real life, we (almost) never build the GUI from scratch. We use control bundles, such as <a href="http://www.telerik.com/products/winforms.aspx">Telerik</a>, <a href="http://www.infragistics.com/dotnet/netadvantage/winforms.aspx#Overview">Infragistics</a>, etc. Otherwise we can spend ages refining our GUI, and the result will probably won't be as good. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we want to use 3rd party controls libraries. We also want the multi-platform capability. Can these two live together? Maybe, in the future. Currently the major GUI controls products are not Mono-Compatible. Here's a compatibility list from<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Third_Party_Controls_Status"> Mono web site</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can we do, besides waiting? Well, I currently don't have a real solution - except for building ugly applications :-) &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will be more than happy to get your suggestions and ideas.</p>
