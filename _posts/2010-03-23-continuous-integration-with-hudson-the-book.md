<p><a href="http://www.wakaleo.com">John Ferguson Smart</a> has started writting a new <a href="http://www.wakaleo.com/books/continuous-integration-with-hudson-the-book">open-source book &quot;Continuous Integration with Hudson&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>He plans not only to describe and document Hudson, but also to provide a wealth of best practices and real-world tips enabling readers to get the most out of their Continuous Integration environment.</p>
<p>There is only one chapter till now, but it looks promising, so we should keep an eye on it, and maybe suggest some of the tips and best practice we have.</p>
