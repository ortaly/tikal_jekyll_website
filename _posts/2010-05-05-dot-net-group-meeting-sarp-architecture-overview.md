<h3>S#arp Architecture</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>Pronounced &quot;Sharp Architecture,&quot; this is a solid architectural  foundation for rapidly building maintainable web applications leveraging  the ASP.NET MVC framework with NHibernate.  The primary advantage to be  sought in using any architectural framework is to decrease the code one  has to write while increasing the quality of the end product.  A  framework should enable developers to spend little time on  infrastructure details while allowing them to focus their attentions on  the domain and user experience.  Accordingly, S#arp Architecture adheres  to the following key principles:<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
    <li>&nbsp;* Focused on Domain  Driven Design</li>
    <li>
    <div>&nbsp;* Loosely coupled</div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div>&nbsp;* Preconfigured  Infrastructure</div>
    </li>
    <li>
    <div>&nbsp;* Open Ended Presentation</div>
    </li>
</ul>
<div><br />
The overall  goal of this is to allow developers to worry less about application  &quot;plumbing&quot; and to spend most of their time on adding value for the  client by focusing on the business logic and developing a rich user  experience.</div>
