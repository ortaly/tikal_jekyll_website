<div>From the site:</div>
<div><span style="font-size: 150%;"><a href="http://uppercut.pbworks.com">UppercuT</a> is the insanely easy to use Automated Build Framework! Automated Builds as easy as (1) solution name, (2) source control path, (3) company name for most projects!!!</span></div>

<p>I stumbled on this project. I don't know how good it is, and can't evaluate it since I'm not in .Net, but the tagline sounds good. What do the .Net guys think?</p>
