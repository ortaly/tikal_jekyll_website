<p>I have found a very nice way of writing posts for the site.</p>
<p>1. Write the post in OpenOffice. When you're done, copy-paste into the site's rich editor. Writing in OpenOffice is much nicer than using the Site's WYWIWYAG (what you want is what you almost get), plus, you get spelling check</p>
<p>2. If you need to insert code snippets, write them in Eclipse, make sure there are no red squigglies (if there are, just make Eclipse implement any missing types or methods). Then, copy paste the code into the OpenOffice document. The code will keep its syntax highlighting (this doesn't work with IDEA). When you paste to the site, the syntax highlighting will still be there.</p>
