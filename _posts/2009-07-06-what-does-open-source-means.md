<p>OK, so we&rsquo;re using MS .NET technologies for years. We are also work in a company that declares itself as a &ldquo;community of professional software developers&rdquo;. But it is &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo;? What is &ldquo;Open Source&rdquo; software and what is it good for? Who gains from Open Source SW usage, and Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answers to all of these questions and more, can be found in a very good presentation about <a target="_blank" xlnet1.com="" http:="" href="http://xlnet1.com/?q=knowledge_cafe/XLnet_open_source_solutions">Open Source usage</a> made by Segev Levi, a former manager at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xlnet1.com">XLNet</a>.</p>
