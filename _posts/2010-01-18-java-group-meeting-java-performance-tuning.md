<p>The event titled &quot;Java performance tuning (tools) and Java code optimization&quot;, is intended to cover a varied array of topics ranging from basic java code optimization to tuning large scale JVMs, heaps and application servers (Jboss, tomcat,Jetty) on multi-core CPUs, 32 and 64 BIT operating systems.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
An effort will be made to introduce the most frequently used tools for JVM memory and thread profiling and monitoring such as jstat, jconsole, jhat, jproiler/yourkit/MAT, VisualVM etc. <br />
<br />
In addition a real world example will be presented in order to demonstrate and discuss the tools and profiling methodologies used.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, this will unsurprisingly be a highly technical session and is intended mostly (<em>though not exclusively</em>) for veteran Java developers. <br />
