<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The next 2 PyWeb-IL meetups will be in the form of a&nbsp;<a href="http://djangodash.com">Django-Dash</a>-like contest. Django-Dash is an event in which teams compete in developing useful applications, in a limited time. This will allow people&nbsp;to code together, in a fun &amp;&nbsp;motivating framework. Actually, the planned event will not be a Dash (more like a Stroll), because the teams will be able to continue working on it for a whole month.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The contest rules &amp; details:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">&nbsp; &nbsp;- Anyone can think of projects they really need but have no time to work&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;on&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- The projects should be Python/Django-based, &amp; must be released as&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Open-Source&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- In the 1st half-an-hour of the 1st meetup (31/Jan), people will&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;describe the projects they thought of (2-minutes per person)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- Then we'll split into small teams, to work on the projects&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- At the end of the 1st meetup, some initial commit should be made&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;(GitHub or BitBucket)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- Unlike the official Django-Dash, the teams may continue to work on&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;their projects in the month after the meetup&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- Then, in the 2nd meetup (28-Feb), we'll have another 2 hours for&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;finishing the projects&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- In the final hour of the meetup, each team will present to everyone the&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;project it implemented (5-min per team)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- A group of distinguished judges, led by Ahik, will score each project&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;in a few criteria &amp; announce the winning team&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- The prizes will be PyCharm licenses to all team members&nbsp;</p>
