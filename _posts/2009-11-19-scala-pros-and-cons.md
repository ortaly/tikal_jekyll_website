<p>Adi, Andrew, Udi.B, Lior and myself recently had a discussion (via Google Wave) about the pros and cons of Scala. The result is this list:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pro's</p>
<p>1. Development time decrease vs. java.</p>
<p>2. Scala is based on JVM vs. other dynamic languages.</p>
<p>3. Java echo system is available for Scala.</p>
<p>4. New design paradigms become available (working with closures, traits)</p>
<p>5. Performance: Scala generate more efficient java code which leads to better runtime performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Con's</p>
<p>1. Larger syntax to learn</p>
<p>2. More skilled programmers required to use the features of the language.</p>
<p>3. Risk of getting code most(?) programmers will not understand.</p>
<p>4. Still in early adopter phase. May not become the language of the future</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
