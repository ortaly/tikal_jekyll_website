<p>from the site: &quot;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Liberation Sans', FreeSans, sans-serif; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); ">This is the Git reference site. This is meant to be a quick reference for learning and remembering the most important and commonly used Git commands. The commands are organized into sections of the type of operation you may be trying to do, and will preset the common options and commands needed to accomplish these common tasks.&quot;</span></p>
