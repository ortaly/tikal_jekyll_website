<p>I saw an ad for a famous US consulting &amp;&nbsp;training company, &amp; went in to check their courses schedule. I was sure it will be mainly Java &amp; J2EE courses &amp; maybe some .Net &amp; Flex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I found:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Python &amp;&nbsp;Django, a little Ruby, but almost all Mobile - iPhone, iPad &amp; Android.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'd better get ready for this trend, before it will be too late..</p>
