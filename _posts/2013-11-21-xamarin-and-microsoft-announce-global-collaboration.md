<p><a href="http://xamarin.com/pr/xamarin-microsoft-partner">http://xamarin.com/pr/xamarin-microsoft-partner</a><br />
Microsoft and Xamarin Partner Globally to Enable Microsoft Developers to<br />
Develop Native iOS and Android Apps With C# and Visual Studio<br />
&hellip;<br />
Xamarin supports 100 percent of both iOS and Android APIs&mdash;anything that can be done in Objective-C or Java can be done in C# with Xamarin.<br />
&hellip;<br />
A technical collaboration to better integrate Xamarin technology with Microsoft developer tools and services.<br />
Aligned with this goal, Xamarin is a SimShip partner for Visual Studio 201<br />
&hellip;<br />
&ldquo;With Xamarin, developers combine all of the productivity benefits of C#, Visual Studio 2013 and Windows Azure with the flexibility to quickly build for multiple device targets.&rdquo;<br />

<p>And my personal take on this right now: after using phonegap (or phonecrap) i think these alternatives are very compelling. along with QT (<a href="http://qt.digia.com/Product/Benefits/Qt-for-Mobile-Development/">http://qt.digia.com/P&hellip;/Benefits/Qt-for-Mobile-Development/</a>) this could be a new and better direction with non of the HTML crap that is not (currently) working well enough as native apps</p>
