On the other hand, I do feel that Drupal lacks documentation. In some cases it seems to take ages to find how to apply simple configurations in Drupal's admin screens. For instance, I spent some time today trying to understand how to perform a simple task, making a page on your site the default site front page, here's how it's done with Drupal 6.x:<br /><br />1. Go to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Admin</span> panel<br /><br />2. Select<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Site Information</span><br /><br />3. scroll down to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Default front page </span>field and insert the name of the page you would like to set as front page<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br /></span><span>4</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">. </span>Press<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Save Configuration<br /><br /></span><div style="text-align: center;"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tECzk8Tdl88/Sr9-rxT9NgI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/bSHixeJYt00/s1600-h/admin.png"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 384px; height: 295px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_tECzk8Tdl88/Sr9-rxT9NgI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/bSHixeJYt00/s400/admin.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5386162969794917890" border="0" /></a><br /></div><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br /></span>
