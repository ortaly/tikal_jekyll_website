<p>I'm looking for example of jee web applications that has pre-configuration feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean first time opening web application in the browser, jump to installation / configuration page and allow</p>
<p>1. configute all of parameters, like database, user, password etc</p>
<p>2. run db script</p>
<p>3. other installation tasks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do such analyze to know, which way is preferrable - add web-based pre-configuration feature to web application or build classic installer. (InstallAnywhere, Install4j)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
