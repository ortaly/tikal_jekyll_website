<p>While I like to have much informative content in my blog than just a link here and there, it happens that often I found good (gr8t) links to relay on that I wish to collect along my way. Here is a great <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/CsharpVsJava.html">detailed comparison between C# to Java programming language features</a>. In my current state (developing c# code for more than 10 years, starting from the beta releases) I can only wish for Java to progress in the giant steps C# makes every year, and have all the goodness the C# language has to offer today. While in the same breath I wish for C# (and Microsoft) to progress in the giant steps that the Open Source Community progresses: revealing new technologies that only later come to use in .Net (like Hibernate, Hadoop, Mongo) etc.â€™
<p>Take a look, you may surprise yourself.</p>
