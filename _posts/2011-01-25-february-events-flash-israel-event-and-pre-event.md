<p>This coming February, some of the top Flash and Flex experts and evangelists are coming to Israel. <a href="http://flashisrael.com/">Flash Israel</a> event will take place on 22-23 February, so ensure you don't miss it! Tikal is sponsoring this event and you are welcome to visit us in Tikal's Booth. I am mostly looking forward to attending the Flex sessions. However, some of the general Flash topics will be very interesting too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the lectures I am planning to attend and the issues covered are listed below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://flashisrael.com/portfolio/hillel-coren-architecting-scalable-flex-applications-using-parsley-and-cairngorm-3/">Hillel Koren</a>, discussing Cairngorm 3 and Parsley, covering DI and other issues.</li>
    <li><a href="http://flashisrael.com/portfolio/kevin-schmidt-learning-the-flex-component-lifecycle/">Kevin Schmidt</a>, covering the Component Life Cycle, discussing both Flex 3 and Flex 4.</li>
    <li><a href="http://flashisrael.com/portfolio/sanyu-kiruluta-playbook-applications-with-air/">Sanyu Kiruluta</a>, showcasing Air development on the new OS of the BlackBerry Tablet.</li>
    <li><a href="http://flashisrael.com/portfolio/elad-elrom-developing-deploying-air-applications-for-tv/">Elad Elrom</a>, covering Air on TV. This is a very interesting session for me. As you may recall, I presented a<a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jd1/archives/2005/09/more-on-orca-sw.html"> TV based Flash SDK</a> over 6 years ago. An application which was also displayed in Macromedia Max 2005.</li>
</ul>
    <p>In addition, some other well-known speakers, such as <a href="http://flashisrael.com/portfolio/grant-skinner-being-distracted-successfully/">Grant Skinner</a>, <a href="http://flashisrael.com/portfolio/ben-forta/">Ben Forta</a>, <a href="http://flashisrael.com/portfolio/lee-brimelow/">Lee Brimellow</a> and <a href="http://flashisrael.com/portfolio/liz-frederick-the-adobe-community/">Liz Fredrik</a> will also speak and present various topics.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">But wait, there's also a </span></em><a style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" href="http://flash-and-flex-israel.eventbrite.com/"><em>Pre event</em></a> on Feb 1, hosting Java Champion and Flex expert <a href="http://flexblog.faratasystems.com/author/yakov">Yakov Fain</a> .Yakov is the co author of <a href="http://www.flexonjava.net/2010/03/book-review-enterprise-development-with.html">Enterprise Development with Flex</a> . There are still free tickets available to the pre event, so go get yours!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Major software companies, such as Microsoft, generally hold big Annual Conferences in Israel. Adobe, on the other hand does not offer such a summit. Therefore, this is the local developers&rsquo; first opportunity to attend such a major event and hear all these great speakers talk.</p>
    <p>The key person behind this event is <a href="http://www.almogdesign.net/">Almog Koren</a>. The event is sponsored by Tikal, Adobe, RIM and Quicksoft and other componies. You can refer to the event's <a href="http://flashisrael.com/category/blog/">blog</a> for further information and updates regarding this event.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Hope to see you all there.</p>
