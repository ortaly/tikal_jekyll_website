<p>With Polymer, Google has taken a new approach in moving the web forward.</p>
<p>From the website: &quot;Polymer is a new type of library for the web, built on top of Web Components, and designed to leverage the evolving web platform on modern browsers.&quot;</p>
<p>For anyone who is familiar with Angular&#39;s Directives, Polymer will feel the same - it aims to bridge the gap between the future of ECMA script with Shadow Dom&#39;s and Web Components to modren browsers that have not implemented this feature yet.</p>
<p>Take a note for this one as a toolbox (the same as jquery) for spreading the reusable UI web components regardless the framework you use (angularjs, backbone, ember etc..).</p>
