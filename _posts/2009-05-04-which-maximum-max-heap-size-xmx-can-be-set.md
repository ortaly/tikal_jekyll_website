<p>What is the maximum value can I put to java as max heap size -Xmx ?</p>
<p>I have java for linux 32 and setting -Xmx<strong>2048m </strong>causes to OutOfMemory during JBoss startup<strong> </strong></p>
<p>Reducing this value to 1G-1.7G solves this problem.</p>
<p>Is this value depends from Linux 32 or 64 if I run under java 32 ?</p>
