<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;As of the release of Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 3, the version of  Java that is ported by Apple, and that ships with Mac OS X, is  deprecated.</p>
<p>This means that the Apple-produced runtime will not be  maintained at the same level, and may be removed from future versions  of Mac OS X.  The Java runtime shipping in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard,  and Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, will continue to be supported and maintained  through the standard support cycles of those products.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that java.oracle.com does not offer an OS X version of JDK or JRE</p>
