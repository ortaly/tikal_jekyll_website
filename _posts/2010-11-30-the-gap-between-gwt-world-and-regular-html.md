<p>When introducing GWT to HTML/Javascript&nbsp; programmer one of the questions that arising, is OK all fine but i am working with a designer how knows HTML/CSS, he doesn't know GWT widgets. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how can I translate the prototype given to me by a designer to a GWT component?</p>
<p><br />
There is of curse UiBinder but let face it's not exactly classic HTML, so after searching the web I found an interesting article which relate to this problem :<a href="http://www.zackgrossbart.com/hackito/tags-first-gwt/"> http://www.zackgrossbart.com/hackito/tags-first-gwt/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
