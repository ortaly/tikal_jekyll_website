<p>Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well&mdash;usually programs they wrote themselves&mdash;and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.</p><br/>
<p>This book's goal is to change that. In it, the authors of twenty-five open source applications explain how their software is structured, and why.</p><br/>
