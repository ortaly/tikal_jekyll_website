<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm currently consulting at a client site where Tomcat is used along with Apache via mod_jk, and from time to time simple requests (=&gt;ping.jsp, which just prints out &quot;OK&quot;) take as long as 10-15 secs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone ever tried to analyze the thread/request ratio automatically (this is a production site and we need constant monitoring)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is mod_proxy considered a better alternative for mod_jk for long http connections?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheers,</p>
<p>z</p>
