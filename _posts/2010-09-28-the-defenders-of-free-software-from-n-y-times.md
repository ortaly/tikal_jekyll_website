<p>An article about Armijn Hemel &amp; the &quot;open source police&quot;.</p>
<p>I always new there are some abusing the OSS &quot;system&quot;, Altough it was quite amazing seeing all the big names in alist for exmaple: <a class="meta-org" title="More information about Cisco Systems Inc" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/cisco_systems_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Cisco  Systems</a>, Samsung, <a class="meta-org" title="More information about Best Buy Company Incorporated" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/best_buy_company/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Best Buy</a>, <a class="meta-org" title="More information about Verizon Communications" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/verizon_communications_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Verizon  Communications</a>, and others are trying to comercialize / 'wrap' OpenSource as their own.</p>
