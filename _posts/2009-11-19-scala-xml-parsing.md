<p>I am looking for the fastest way to transform XML string into POJO graph.</p>
<p>I receive string via REST APi and trying to parse in with Scala.</p>
<p>Most of documentation on Scala leads to XML serialization or manipulation, not parsing.</p>
<p>Can anybody suggest an example to solution ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
