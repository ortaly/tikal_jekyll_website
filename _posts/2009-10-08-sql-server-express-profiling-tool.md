<p>MS SQL Server 2005 and 2008 express editions are widely used, but they miss several tools the more &quot;high-end&quot; versions provide. One of these missing tools is a profiler. <a href="http://sqlprofiler.googlepages.com/">Here is a profiler for the express editions.</a>&nbsp;It is free and open source. I haven't tried it yet, and will be glad to receive some input from those of you that did.</p>
