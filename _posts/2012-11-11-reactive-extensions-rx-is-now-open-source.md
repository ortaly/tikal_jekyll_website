<p>Today, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2012/04/12/announcing-one-more-way-microsoft-will-engage-with-the-open-source-and-standards-communities.aspx">Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc</a>., is open sourcing Rx. Its source code is now hosted on <a href="https://rx.codeplex.com/">CodePlex</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Reactive Extensions:
<ul>
<li>Rx.NET: The Reactive Extensions (Rx) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and LINQ-style query operators.
<li>RxJS: The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and LINQ-style query operators in JavaScript which can target both the browser and Node.js.
<li>Rx++: The Reactive Extensions for Native (RxC) is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and LINQ-style query operators in both C and C++. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Interactive Extensions
<ul>
<li>Ix: The Interactive Extensions (Ix) is a .NET library which extends LINQ to Objects to provide many of the operators available in Rx but targeted for IEnumerable<T>.
<li>IxJS: An implementation of LINQ to Objects and the Interactive Extensions (Ix) in JavaScript.
<li>Ix++: An implantation of LINQ for Native Developers in C++ </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p><em>“GitHub for Windows uses the Reactive Extensions for almost everything it does, including network requests, UI events, managing child processes (git.exe). Using Rx and ReactiveUI, we’ve written a fast, nearly 100% asynchronous, responsive application, while still having 100% deterministic, reliable unit tests. The desktop developers at GitHub loved Rx so much, that the Mac team created their own version of Rx and ReactiveUI, called ReactiveCocoa, and are now using it on the Mac to obtain similar benefits.” – Paul Betts, GitHub</em></p>
