<p>Finally W3C says HTML 5 is “feature complete”. It should be released in early 2014 (in 2011 they sais it would be on Dec 2012)</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/17/technology/html5/index.html?source=linkedin" target="_blank">TML5, the long-in-the-works update to the language that powers the Web, is “feature complete,” according to an announcement made Monday by the standards-setting Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C). There’s still some testing to be done, and it hasn’t yet become an official Web standard — that will come in 2014. But there won’t be any new features added to HTML5, which means Web designers and app makers now have a “stable target” for implementing it, W3C said.</a></p>
