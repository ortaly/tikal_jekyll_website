<p>pjax supports creating links that update only part of the page. this  allows updating just the content, leaving headers, sidebars and such  as-is, avoiding full page reload. the links support the back button, can  be opened in a new tab and degrade nicely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it is used in the new github issues subsystem</p>
