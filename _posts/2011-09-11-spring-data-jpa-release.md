<p>Spring JPA aims to significantly improve the     implementation of data access layers by reducing the effort to the     amount that's actually needed. As a developer you write your     repository interfaces, including custom finder methods, and Spring     will provide the implementation automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to feel what Spring JPA is go to the getting-started tutorial at <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/02/10/getting-started-with-spring-data-jpa/">Spring Source Team Blog</a></p>
