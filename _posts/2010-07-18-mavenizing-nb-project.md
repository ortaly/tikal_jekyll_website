<p>hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have experience with migrating a large NetBeans GUI project to Maven?</p>
<p>The project in question is divided into tens of submodules, contains hundreds of configuration files, and currently genmerates (using&nbsp; NetBeans's Ant files) a directory structure containing over 10,000 files and directories.</p>
<p>Is there any tool that does the job or some of it? Are you aware of NetBeans support for that scenario?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
