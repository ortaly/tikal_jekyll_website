<p>I want to make a number of tests, which inherit from each other, due to common functionality.</p>
<p>The problem is when running each class, JUnit executes all tests within that class, therefore i run some tests number of times, which is absolutley unneccessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can i avoid this ?</p>
