<p>Stumbled upon Jboss Seam I can't beleive what I see.</p>
<p>I jsut read some pdf , explaining Seam features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. JSF part is seemingly improved, I found many useful things right out of the box, that I previously coded. </p>
<p>2. Validations through all the system, vertical and horizontal</p>
<p>3. helpful rendering of highlights for validated components.</p>
<p>4. out of the box transaction support(that is not unique to SEAM, but good with all the rest)</p>
<p>5. conversations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That what I only happend to discover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now tell me the truth, is it really such good thing as they argue?</p>
<p>What is your real life experience with SEAM?</p>
<p>What is on problem part? What drawbacks and neglects have you noticed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
