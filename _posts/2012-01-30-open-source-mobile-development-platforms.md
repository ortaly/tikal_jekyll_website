<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p>With the introduction of the iPhone and Android Mobile devices a new medium was created.  Touch-screens and smart mobile devices have created an historic technological revolution.  These new devices are in the hands of millions of people all the time.  With the mobile revolution, a new and unique opportunity has been created that companies can leverage to put their content into the hands of the masses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However,  the introduction of these new devices brought with it the creation of many new frameworks for creating content.  Each mobile platform has it's own development and design techniques.  With all these choices,  companies have to choose carefully when picking what approach to take.  The most important decision is picking between native development for each device or using one of the many open source options that use a write once deploy to many approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choosing to program natively has many advantages.  By hiring a programmer proficient in iOS,  for example,  you will be able to create an app that can take advantage of all the features included in the iOS SDK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had hands on experience with many frameworks used to develop mobile applications.  In this article series I would like to share with you a list of some of my favorite Open Source options. Many of these open source options allow for the reuse of existing HTML and Javascript application logic already familiar to existing web developers.  Another advantage is the ability to deploy the code as a native mobile app on multiple platforms.</p>
<h1><a target="_blank" href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on HTML5, PhoneGap leverages web technologies developers already know best... HTML, JavaScript and CSS.  PhoneGap has been around for many years now and was recently aqcuired by Adobe.  PhoneGap is an open source implementation of open standards. That means developers and companies can use PhoneGap for mobile applications that are free, commercial, open source, or any combination of these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since winning the <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/phone_gap_todays_peoples_choice_winner_at_launch_p.php">Web 2.0 Expo LaunchPad competition in April 2009</a>, PhoneGap has been widely recognized as a game-changer for mobile app development. The code has been downloaded more than 600,000 times and thousands of apps built using PhoneGap are available in mobile app stores and directories. Check out some of them <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/apps/">here</a>.</p>
