<p>Oracle Corporation is to buy Sun Microsystems Inc. for $9.50 a share in a deal valued at $7.4 billion, just a few weeks after a deal by IBM to buy Sun fell apart. It looks like Oracle will pay a premium of $2.81 a share, or 42%, over Sun Micro&rsquo;s closing price of $6.69 a share on Friday. Oracle said the deal is valued at $5.6 billion excluding cash and debt. Oracle is calling Sun&rsquo;s Java &ldquo;the most important software&rdquo; it has ever acquired. The deal has massive implications for the future openness of Java and MySQL.</p>
