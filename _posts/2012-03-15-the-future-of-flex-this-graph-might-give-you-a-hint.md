<p><span style="font-size: larger;">Recently I've been meeting many Flex developers who are trying to figure  out where's the Flex job market going, mostly asking themselves if it's  time to switch to HTML5 or other client technologies. This graph might  give you a hint. The graph displays the percentage of jobs found for  each search terms on </span><a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.indeed.com/jobanalytics/jobtrends?q=HTML5%2C+flex&amp;l="><span style="font-size: larger;">indeed.com</span></a><span style="font-size: larger;">.  According to this graph, demand for Flex developers is obviously taking  a huge fall while demand for HTML5 is rising in an amazing rate.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;">I find two possible explanations to the graph, each one is also introducing a different forecast :<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;"><font style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">[Pessimistic] Flex is vanishing from the industry</font>,  in a couple of years it will no longer be used for new projects, Flex  developers will still be able to find jobs maintaining existing  projects, very much like developer of other technologies that have  vanished form the job market.</span><span style="font-size: larger;"><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;"><font style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">[Optimistic] The market is over reacting</font>  to Adobe's recent Flex related strategy. Yes, some companies are  avoiding the use of Flex for new projects and are exploring new  technologies, but soon those companies will find out the obvious,  HTML5\JS Are not mature enough and at this point can not offer companies  a real alternative to Flex. Many of these companies will soon  understand that leaving Flex was a mistake. They will get back to hiring  Flex developers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: larger;">Which one of these forecasts is the right one? we'll just have to wait and see.</span></p>
