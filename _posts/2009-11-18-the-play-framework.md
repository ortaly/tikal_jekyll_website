<p>http://www.playframework.org/ is similar in concept to develop in Django or Rails. That is, no compile-package-deploy. Change the code and refresh the browser, see source code for errors etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the site to see the video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the site:</p>
<p><strong>Fix the bug and hit reload!</strong> Edit your Java files, save, refresh your browser and see 		the results immediately! No need to compile, deploy or restart the server.</p>
<p><strong>Stateless model</strong> Play is a real &quot;Share nothing&quot; system. Ready for REST, it is easily scaled 		by running multiple instances of the same application on several servers.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient template system</strong> A clean template system based on Groovy as an expression language. 		It provides template inheritence, includes and tags.</p>
<p><strong>Resolve errors quickly</strong> When an error occurs, play shows you the source code and the 		exact line containing the problem. Even in templates.</p>
<p><strong>All you need to create a cool web application</strong> Provides integration with Hibernate, 		OpenID, Memcached... And a plugin system.</p>
<p><strong>Pure Java</strong> Code with Java, use any Java library and develop with your preferred IDE. 		Integrates nicely with eclipse or netbeans.</p>
<p><strong>Really fast</strong> Starts fast and runs fast!</p>

<p>P.s. version 1.1 will have support for Scala</p>
