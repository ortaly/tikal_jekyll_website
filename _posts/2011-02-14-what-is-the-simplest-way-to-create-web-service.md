<p>I'm planing to write some web service from scratch. The service must be secured &amp; will massivelly use the DB.</p>
<p>I looking for framework(s) for completing such project without reach expirience in web developing.</p>
<p>It must be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Easy to learn/use</li>
    <li>Fast &amp; iterative development</li>
    <li>Scalable (the service can grow into complex project with huge db) &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Ability to upgrade the system on the fly (upgrade of functionality + db)</li>
    <li>And of course freeware as much as possible&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I taking this project as study case - so any platforms/languages/methodologies will be taken into account.</p>
