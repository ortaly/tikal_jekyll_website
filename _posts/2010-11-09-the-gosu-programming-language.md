<p>Gosu is (yet)&nbsp;another programming language for the JVM. Unlike most  others, it is statically typed. It seems to be C# for Java, featuring  just the simpler concepts that make programming more productive. Its  tagline is that it is imperative (not to scare people away with concepts  like FP)</p>
