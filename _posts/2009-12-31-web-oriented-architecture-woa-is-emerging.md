<p>The principles of WOA are:</p>
<p>1. It is a resource-oriented architecture (ROA) - so it is based on URIs and hyper-links</p>
<p>2. It is based on the web protocols for discovery and consumption - e.g. granular stateless services using REST much like with SOA.</p>
<p>3. It encourages linked-data - so different apps and data can reuse APIs and vocabularies to support mashups (WEB3.0).</p>
<p>4. Open yet secured</p>
