<p>Hi,</p>
<p>One of our customers needs a &quot;license product&quot; which can support his own product distribution. This third party &quot;license product&quot; can help him define the licese through configuration - i.e. 30 days free trial and then add a key for an eternal license, limit number of users etc.</p>
<p>The customer product server iis a Java based with JBoss AS, and is based on Spring / Hibernate. The client is Web based (provide both UI and SOAP Web Services)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know/recommend about any open-source/commercial product which can be used &quot;out of the box&quot; with some configurations for it ?</p>
