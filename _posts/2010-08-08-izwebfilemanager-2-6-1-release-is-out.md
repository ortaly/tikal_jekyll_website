I am very happy to announce that IZWebFileManager 2.6.1 has been released.<br /><br />The main feature of this release is support of applications running in "Medium Trust" environment.<br /><br />I added following <span style="font-weight: bold;"><trust level="Medium"></trust></span> directive in Demo's web.config to enforce security restrictions when you run it.<br /><br />The release is available for download from Google Code<br /><a href="https://code.google.com/p/izwebfilemanager/">https://code.google.com/p/izwebfilemanager/</a>
