<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This package adds a MessageBodyWriter to Jersey that can use Lift's template mechanism for generating the XML output of a resource (REST call).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The templates can either be files that are located by the writer according to naming conventions based on the resource name. Alternatively, they can be embedded as a result of the method (XML is a native type in Scala)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the README for references to examples</p>
