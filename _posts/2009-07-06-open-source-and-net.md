<p>&ldquo;Tikal is a leading provider of open source solutions for software development.&rdquo; (from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tikalk.com/About-Tikal">about</a> page). We at Tikal would also like to consider ourselves as a community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s Microsoft and its proprietary technology AKA .NET&hellip; So, why do we try to mix oil with water?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is simple &ndash; we do not.  Strangely enough, we&rsquo;re not even the first to think about it! Microsoft set up a website for open source project hosting, called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.CodePlex.com">CodePlex</a>. It&rsquo;s on growing community of Open Source enthusiastic, and invites them to create Open Source projects and to contribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, long before CodePlex, MS released a set of tools called Application Blocks. An application block is a tool, or a set of tools, formed to solve a common addressed problem. Widely used Application Blocks are Data Access Application Block, and Unity application Block (light-weight Inversion of Control container). All these Application Blocks are gathered into a general <a target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/practices/default.aspx">Patterns and Practices</a>, which Microsoft declares as &ldquo;Microsoft's proven practices for software engineering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A better emphasize (I think) on the involvement of MS in the Open Source world is: <a target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;" href="http://port25.technet.com/">Port25</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but not least, in my opinion, one of the most surprising links one may find is <a target="&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;" href="http://www.microsoft.com/opensource/">Microsoft&rsquo;s Open Source page</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, we have a fast groing Open Source .NET community. It's a world wide trend - and as a community in Tikal are starting to become part of it.</p>
