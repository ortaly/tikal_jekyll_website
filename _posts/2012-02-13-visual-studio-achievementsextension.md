There are so many features and tool underneath VS folds that not many programmers know or use. The VS team has created an extension for VS enabling you to score point with every achievement you earn, here you go:<br />

<p> 
<p>With the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/achievements/visualstudio">Visual Studio Achievements Extension</a>, various achievements are unlocked based on your activity. When you unlock an achievement, Visual Studio lets you know visually with a pop-up. In addition, your Channel 9 profile is updated with any achievements you earn, recalculating your position on the leaderboard. Now, all that hard work won’t go unnoticed! <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/site/tbd">Download it today!</a>
<p>There are six categories of achievements you can earn, including categories like <b>Unleashing Visual Studio</b>, <b>Power Coder</b>, <b>Don’t Try This At Home</b> and more. Some examples of individual achievements include <b>Regional Manager</b> (have more than 10 regions in a single class), <b>Close To The Metal</b> (use 5 preprocessor directives), <b>Stubby</b> (generate method stubs 10 times) or <b>Interrupting Cow</b> (have 10 breakpoints in a file). All in all, there are 32 achievements awaiting to be unlocked.
<p>To see a list of all the achievements, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/achievements/visualstudio">check out this page</a>. You can also see where you and your fellow niners stand on the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/achievements/visualstudio/leaderboard">leaderboard</a>. You can tweet and share your achievements on Facebook. Or, add your list of achievements to your blog. After all, those badges look so shiny and nice!</p>

<p>You can download the plugin <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/bc7a433b-b594-48d4-bba2-a2f24774d02f">here</a>, and set your profile <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/achievements/visualstudio">here</a>. The extension is in beta so be patient. After playing with it for a while you can see your score if you enter the extension via the extensions menu. And it seems that it only updates with every 5 minutes or so. This could be a nice lead to learn some new features while you play. </p>
