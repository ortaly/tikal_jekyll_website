<p>If you haven't decided yet which validation framework to use with your ASP.NET MVC application then check out <a href="http://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com/wikipage">Fluent Validation</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;A small validation library for .NET that uses a fluent interface and  lambda expressions for building validation rules for your business  objects.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. lambda expressions seems to be only language in the future. :)</p>
