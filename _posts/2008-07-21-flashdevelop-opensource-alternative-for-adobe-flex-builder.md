<p><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_42"><span class="thmr_call" id="thmr_6"><p>FlashDevelop is an open source project, created for AS2 and&nbsp;AS3 projects. It&rsquo;s an <strong>IDE</strong> which can be a good alternative for a <strong>Flex Builder</strong> from adobe. The main advantage is that it&rsquo;s free! It&rsquo;s also a lot lighter. It has a code autocompleter, panels for presenting errors, warnings and tasks. It&rsquo;s very like Flex Builder, but it doesn&rsquo;t have visual editor.</p></span></span></p>
