<p>Fro those of us not familiar with SQL CE, here's a short description from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Sqlserver/2008/en/us/compact.aspx">MS website</a>: &quot;Microsoft SQL Server Compact is a free SQL Server embedded database ideal for building standalone and occasionally connected applications for mobile devices, desktops, and Web clients.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do use it, you'll find a huge limitation: lack of tools - even standard ones. One of the most problematic thing is the lack of easy way to generate schema and data SQL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great solution is now hosted in Code Plex called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Sqlserver/2008/en/us/compact.aspx">SQL Compact data and schema script utility </a>. It contains command line tool that export's your database - data and schema to SQL file. But that's not all. It also contains an add-on to SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) that does all this, so we get a nice GUI to activate this tool.</p>
