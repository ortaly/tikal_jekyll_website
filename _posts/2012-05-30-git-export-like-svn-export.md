<p>I have been working with git for a while now on my <a href='http://www.kensodev.com/2011/09/16/kill-all-resque-workers-with-a-single-command/' title='Ruby on Rails'>Ruby on Rails</a> projects and client side (css, Html and <a href='http://www.kensodev.com/tag/javascript/' title='JavaScript'>JavaScript</a>) projects. I havenâ€™t moved completely in <a href='http://www.kensodev.com/category/flex/' title='Flex'>flex</a> projects and other projects, but I do plan to in the near future, mainly because of the reason that you can integrate <a href='http://www.kensodev.com/tag/git/' title='GIT'>GIT</a> into flash builder 4. But, that is not the point.</p>

<p>This week I was working with a company on a client side project. I had to email them the files every time and the .git folders inside the project were heavy and unnecessary.</p>

<p>If you worked with SVN, you probably know the export command, after searching for a bit in git help I found how you can do it in git with ease.</p>
<strong>How to do?</strong>
<p>This is the command you should use:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>git checkout-index -a -f --prefix<span class='o'>=</span>/path/to/your/folder/
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The ending forward slash is very important! Do not forget to use it please.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
