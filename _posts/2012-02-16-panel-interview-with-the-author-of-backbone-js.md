<p>The <a href="http://castroller.com/Podcasts/JavascriptJabber">JavaScript Jabber</a> podcast did an <a href="http://javascriptjabber.com/004-jsj-backbone-js-with-jeremy-ashkenas/">interview with Jeremy Ashkenas</a>, the author of <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a> (as well as CoffeeScript). The panelists interviewing him included also Yehuda Katz, the author of the competing MVC framework <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backbone.js is the leading JavaScript MVC framework &amp; the interview sheds light on its history &amp; the design principles behind it, especially in comparison with other MVC frameworks.</p>
