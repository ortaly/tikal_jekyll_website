<p>&nbsp;I came across a great open source library today called Eskimo. &nbsp;Eskimo contains Flex Controls that are coded to behave like native controls on various mobile platforms like iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eskimo is:&nbsp;An open source Flex mobile library providing native control patterns to your apps on multiple mobile platforms.</p>
<p>Feel free to download the library over at <a href="http://e-skimo.com/">Eskimo's</a> website. &nbsp;It is currently available as a SWC since it is still in beta testing but, &nbsp;a september release of the code is planned.</p>
