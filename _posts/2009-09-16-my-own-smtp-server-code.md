<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i want to write my own SMTP server, i just need to be able to receive messages from this server.</p>
<p>I'm not looking for a mail server and not for installation:</p>
<p>jboss mail server (http://www.jboss.org/community/wiki/MailServicesInstallingM1) isn't good for me because it has to be installed and we want to avoid that. neither James by Apache isn't good because of this same reason.</p>
<p>any idea?</p>
