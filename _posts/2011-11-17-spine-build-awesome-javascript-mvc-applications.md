<p>Spine is an MVC framework to build client side web applications. It is modeled after Rails, with integration for the server side. It is also built using Coffeescript and supports writing applications in Coffeescript.</p>

<p>Another core value is that it focuses on making interactions with the server asynchronous, thus reducing the percieved load time of data. </p>
