<p>The long awaited ability to debug HTML on your android using your desktop is here. But, only if you are using kitkat 4.4. under the hood, kitkat is using chrome 30 instead of the unknown &ldquo;Android Browser&rdquo;, also we get all the new HTML 5 features like web workers and web sockets&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/android-4-4-kitkat-browser-chrome-webview">ability to debug remotely Android native webviews &ndash;including PhoneGap apps- and the Android Browser and it works smoothly both from real devices and from the emulator.</a></p>
