<p>Excerpt:</p>

<p>When working on large scale projects, java back-end code is usually being built using&nbsp;Apache Maven.<br />
This is usually part of a larger framework in charge of project life cycle that is part of the Continuous Integration DevOps realm, either&nbsp;Hudson,&nbsp;Jenkins&nbsp;or something else.<br />
In such a case, you&rsquo;d want your&nbsp;AngularJS&nbsp;code to run&nbsp;grunt/gulp&nbsp;as part of the CI procedure as well.</p>
