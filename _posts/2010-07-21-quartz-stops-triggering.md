<p>I'm having a problem with quartz - i have multiple (~5) triggers which at some point one of them simply stops triggering events.</p>
<p>I saw an open bug related to this issue and even with the latest version, it can happen after few minutes/hours/days the trigger refuse to continue.</p>
<p>Anyone got across this problem before? any solution?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
