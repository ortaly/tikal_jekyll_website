<p>I've been searching for free development management tools running on windows and finally found this one - <a href="http://bugnetproject.com/">BugNET - open source issue tracker</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a great tool,  built using C# and the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" style="background-color: white; color: #3366cc; cursor: pointer; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;" href="http://asp.net/">ASP.NET</a>&nbsp;platform and provides features such issues tracking and project management.&nbsp;Full list of features may be found <a href="http://bugnetproject.com/Documentation/tabid/57/topic/Features/Default.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current state is beta, but it is developed rapidly, so release should not take long.</p>
