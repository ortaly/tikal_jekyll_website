<p>A great trick to decorate the current_user method from devise using Draper.</p>
<p>IMHO it’s actually applicable to any authentication system out there that is using current_user but that requires some testing.</p>
<p>Decorators are an awesome way to remove logic from the view or the models, so the models have real business logic and the rest can be “decorated” with another class.</p>
<p>If you are looking for more information about decorators, Ryan Bates has a great screencast about it here: <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/286-draper" target="_blank">http://railscasts.com/episodes/286-draper</a></p>
<p>Enjoy</p>
