<p>Very sool we will get new view engine from ASP.NET MVC.</p>
<p>It is under development with codename &quot;Razor&quot;.</p>
<p>read more about in <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx">Scott  Guthrie's blog</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why we nee yet another view engine? Is it better then others?</p>
<p>By me the best feature of &quot;Razor&quot; is integration with Visual Studio (due to made by MS).</p>
<p>Of couse I will prefer it to others since they have no such feature, but it drives me to get locked into MS world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get deep breath and waiting for release...</p>
