<p>The project suggests a new paradigm for an IDE. The IDE presents an infinite virtual desktop and pieces of information are opened as bubbles. These pieces can be methods, searches, debug inspections. The IDE interlinks them and allows to save the opened bubbles for future reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's an 8 minute video in the link above that features the IDE's capabilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IDE is built on top of Eclipse, so in theory it can work with any Eclipse project.</p>
