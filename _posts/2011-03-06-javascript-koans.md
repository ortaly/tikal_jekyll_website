<p>The one of the fast way to learn javascript - JavaScript-Koans</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;JavaScript Koans is an interactive learning environment that uses failing tests to introduce students to aspects of JavaScript in a logical sequence.   The inspiration for this project comes from the Edgecase Ruby Koans and the book 'Javascript: The Good Parts'.  Open the file jskoans.htm in your favourite browser and make the tests pass.&quot;</p>
