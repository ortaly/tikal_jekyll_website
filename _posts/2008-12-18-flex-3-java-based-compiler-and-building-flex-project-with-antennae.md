<p>Integrating Java and Flex has proven challenging in some cases. Adobe is trying to make things easier with its release of Flex 3 which includes a <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/flexdoc/2008/01/compiler_api.html">Java-based compiler API</a>. This API lets you compile SWF and SWC files from Java applications, supporting the same options as mxmlc and compc command-line tools.</p><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/antennae/">Antennae</a>, a set of templates for building complex Flex projects with Ant has been available for some time now.</p>
