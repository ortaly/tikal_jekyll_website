I had to perform a simple task today, which included creating a Label with an Icon, using Swing's ImageIcon class. I looked into swing six years ago. Then, at the time I was the first Flex person in a Java developerâ€™s team. The company I was working for was switching from Swing to Flex. It is interesting to look at Swing and learn how the concept of productivity in a GUI development environment has changed over such a short time period. For instance, this is how the Swing manual <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/icon.html">suggests</a> that you create a label with an Icon:<br /><br /><pre style="font-family: Andale Mono, Lucida Console, Monaco, fixed, monospace; color: #000000; background-color: #eee;font-size: 12px;border: 1px dashed #999999;line-height: 14px;padding: 5px; overflow: auto; width: 100%"><code>ImageIcon icon = createImageIcon("images/middle.gif",<br />                            "a pretty but meaningless splat");<br />label1 = new JLabel("Image and Text", icon, JLabel.CENTER);<br />...<br />label3 = new JLabel(icon);<br /><br />/** Returns an ImageIcon, or null if the path was invalid. */<br />protected ImageIcon createImageIcon(String path,<br />                                      String description) {<br />java.net.URL imgURL = getClass().getResource(path);<br />if (imgURL != null) {<br />   return new ImageIcon(imgURL, description);<br />} else {<br />   System.err.println("Couldn't find file: " + path);<br />   return null;<br />}<br />}<br /></code></pre>Can you imagine? All this code is required for a simple Label with an Icon! Software<br />development has changed in the last few years. Platforms and languages are expected to be more efficient and require less code and time from the developer.
