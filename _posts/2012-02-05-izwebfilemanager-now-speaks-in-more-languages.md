<p>Recently I got a contribution from BeJay, one of IZWebFileManager users.  It was 3 new language resource files: China, Czech&nbsp; and Slovakia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So by now IZWebFileManager supports 17 languages! Isn't it great?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most recent release available for download from google code: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/izwebfilemanager/">http://code.google.com/p/izwebfilemanager/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IZWebFileManager is an open source project. You are welcome to contribute!</p>
