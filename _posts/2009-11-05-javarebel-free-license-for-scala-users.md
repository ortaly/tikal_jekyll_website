<p>from the site:</p>
<p>About a year ago we decided to <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=49443">support the Scala community</a> by providing a free license of JavaRebel to all Scala users. The licenses provided at that time have expired but we want to continue and improve our support.</p>
<p>Instead of a license that expires on a set date &ndash; you can now get a license with your name on it that lasts a full year. After that, just re-apply and voila: you&rsquo;ll have a new key in your inbox.</p>
<p><strong>NB! The JRebel Scala license will only work with .scala files. It will not work for usual Java classes!</strong></p>
