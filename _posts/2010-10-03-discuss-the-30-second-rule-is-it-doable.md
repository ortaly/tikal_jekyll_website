<p class="MsoNormal">Hi All,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A blog post I have  stumbled upon today see: <a href="http://www.cubeia.com/index.php/blog/archives/131">http://www.cubeia.com/index.php/blog/archives/131</a>  is really pointing out everything we are working to accomplish (and  some may already have).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Setup &amp; Installation procedures aren't only   for end-users, at least not IMHO.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Is it doable ?, I  presume so! </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Can we decrease the time spent  on setting up environments, databases, dependencies etc &hellip;, again I am sure it can be done the  question is: is there one solution that scales, fit everyone ?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to  hear some ideas ...</p>
