<p>Lately I have heard all kind of saying about JavaFX, some said that it's lame and that you can hardly draw a circle, some said that it's pretty cool. I set down and started googeling :-@ looking for the real answer...</p> <p>First I did a pretty simple tutorial - clock application, a real one which even works ;-) I followed the instructions and I have to say that this time I did it by the book, meaning I even installed NetBeans and enjoyed that very much, this was my first NetBeans use since I have tried an early version back then. JavaFX NetBeans environment is very nice you can drag and drop all kind of stuff from a pallete which generates the code for you. Nice formatting feature which organize your code and you get even a preview to your work. One major con was that I couldn't organize my imports - that was very annoying. Else then that you have all you need for creating your JavaFx application.</p> <p>The tutorial went well and an awesome clock came to life. But hey if you want to build a real business application you need a lot more then just basic graphics capabilities.</p> <p>I moved on to the next step looking for basic components and for decent client server communication. After a little research I found couple of examples of how you can use a WebService and even talking JSON and with JavaFX binding feature you are good to go.</p> <p>So far so good - I saw some good looking graphics applications examples I have client server communication now all I need is some basic components and maybe a charts bundle. Here is the problem I had to try very hard to come up with a Pie chart that someone did I cannot even talk about basic UI Components like data grid. If you want it you have to write it or look for someone whom already wrote one.</p> <p>You might want to have a look at Project Scene Graph which can handle Swing Components, but you really want that? Going back to Swing? I don't really think so.</p> <p>Another little thought was about the Applet. I can remember the fear from those Applets where building business applications, no customer wanted it in his production, security issues they said, I wonder if that's going to change?</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclution</span>:</p><p>JavaFX is a cool technology which make your code simple and you can easily create a RIA business application, although it's making a nice progress it's still not there. You still have to code a lot to get a basic application. It looks like we'll have to wait some more until it's ready... I think that when it'll be ready then it will rock.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resources</strong>:</p><p>http://java.sun.com/javafx/tutorials/jfx_nb_getting_started/#1a</p><p>http://www.apress.com/book/preview/9781590599457</p><p>http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/scripting/javafxpart1/</p><p>http://java.dzone.com/articles/compiled-javafx-script-now-spe</p><p>http://www.nobel-joergensen.com/roller/java/entry/pie_chart_in_javafx_script</p><p>http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-javafx/</p><p>https://scenegraph.dev.java.net/</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
