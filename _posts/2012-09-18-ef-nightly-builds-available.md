<p>The EF team have just completed the first round to become true open source and published their nightly builds to the world. The second step will be the future road map. A link is available but as the official blog states</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://entityframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=specs">No feature specifications are available yet. As we start designing the features to be included in the Entity Framework 6 release the specifications will be available on this page.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Well, good enough for now.</p>
