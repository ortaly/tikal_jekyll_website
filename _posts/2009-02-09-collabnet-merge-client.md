<p>The <span><span>CollabNet</span></span> Merge Client has been built on top of Eclipse and <span><span>Subclipse</span></span> and also on top of the merge tracking feature of Subversion 1.5 and requires Subversion 1.5 on the client.</p>
<p>They define their goal as &quot;make merge easier&quot;, and so it is - nice interface with use cases will make your life with <span><span>svn</span></span> merges much easier, recommended for non-eclipse user as well as a general Subversion UI, or even just to perform merges.</p>
