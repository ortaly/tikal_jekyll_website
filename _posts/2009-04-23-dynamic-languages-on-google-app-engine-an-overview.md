<p>As mentioned in a post a few minute ago here, Google has released App Engine support for Java. This is obviously very cool - and I&rsquo;ve spent a few weeks testing several things using it. It should come as no surprise that my main goal with this investigation has been to see how dynamic languages fit in with the Java story.</p>
