<p>Traceur is a JavaScript.next-to-JavaScript-of-today compiler that allows you to use features from the future <strong>today</strong>.  Traceur's goal is to inform the design of new JavaScript features which  are only valuable if they allow you to write better code. Traceur  allows you to try out new and proposed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/traceur-compiler/wiki/LanguageFeatures">language features</a> today, helping you say what you mean in your code while informing the standards process.</p>
