<p>Using JAXWS I create a lot of dynamic proxies.</p><p>I pay attention that creating proxy causes to growing loaded classes in the JVM, &nbsp; together with it grow Non-Heap Memory usage.</p><p>As I understand JAXWS creates Dynamic Proxies.</p><p>Does these Proxies live in the Non-Heap Memory ?</p><p>How these proxies can be cleaned out ?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
