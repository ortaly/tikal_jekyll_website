<p>The public draft of the JPA 2.0 specification is <a class="regularLink" target="" href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=317">already out</a> and includes a much-awaited feature: an API that lets you create queries by calling methods of Java objects, instead of by embedding JPA-QL into strings that are parsed by the JPA implementation.</p>
