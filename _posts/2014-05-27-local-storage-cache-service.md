<p>Excerpt:</p>

<p>We all need access to the local storage every once in a while.<br />
Usually it&rsquo;s for locally storing state variables or data retrieved from the server that does not change throughout the life of the application.<br />
It can save up some loading time on subsequent executions as well as reduce server load.</p>
