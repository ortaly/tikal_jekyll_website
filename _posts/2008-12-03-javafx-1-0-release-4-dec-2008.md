<p>You can see a little buzz about upcoming JavaFX first release 1.0 (4 Dec 2008).</p><p>I have opened their site http://javafx.com/ and it looks like they have a bit of a problem with IE7 - You better try it using FireFox ;) Another thing was the splash window which you cannot close or better to say, Oh its a feature... sure. I'll probably will download it and see what's new....</p><h3>Coming on Thursday: JavaFX 1.0 including FX Mobile prerelease</h3><p>http://weblogs.java.net/blog/terrencebarr/archive/2008/12/coming_on_thurs.html</p>
