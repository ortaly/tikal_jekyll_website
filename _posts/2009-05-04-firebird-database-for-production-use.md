<p>Has anyone had experience with this database (Formerly known as Interbase)?</p>
<p>More specifically, how does it perform with type 4 JDBC driver? How does it scale with TB's of information?</p>
<p>Anyone used the native type 3 JDBC driver?</p>
<p>Anyone had problems with HIBERNATE?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
