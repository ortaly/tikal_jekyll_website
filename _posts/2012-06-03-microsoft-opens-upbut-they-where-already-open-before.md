<p>So Microsoft has gone open source, well, that’s old news if you ask me. I think that long time now Microsoft is not the devil and since the late 90’s the time has changed with new giants on the scene.
<p>If you want to develop using MS technologies (like C#) you can use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express">Visual Studio Express</a> for free.
<p>If you want to learn how to use their tools and libs, beside the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">MSDN</a>, you can view movies on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">channel 9</a>, or dedicated sites like asp.net/mvc
<p>If you want to share your code or start your own open source project, you can use <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/">codeplex</a> (or any other site like github)
<p>If you want cloud services, you can use <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/">Azure</a> (for this one you’ll have to pay), unlike Google engine that is free for beginners plan
<p>If you want to change their code, up until now – you can use your user vote or write an extension on your own. Or use one of their open libs like <a href="http://entlib.codeplex.com/">Enterprise Library</a> or <a href="http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/">Prism</a>.
<p>From now on, most of their projects are open source and you can contribute code by yourself.
<p>If you are building your own company, you can join the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/">bizspark</a> program and get full access to everything MS has to offer.
<p>The beautiful thing about MS, is that they are always getting better. look at VS compare to eclipse. While eclipse is great VS is getting better and better in a fast pace with tones of features (like DB schema compare, architecture explorer, tons of extensions and alike).
<p>Look at C# compared to Java. C# has lambda, anonymous types, async built in, tons of libs and every year or so we have a new version. on the other hand the Java community looks at Scala or other sourced to get better.
<p>Look at Entity Framework that started with a lame ORM solution and now supports enums, more than 4 different programming models.
<p>Yes, most of the new stuff comes from the open source community, and as always, MS takes the lead lingering behind but eventually giving a better, more well-formed solution. but that is only if you wanna wait for them. You/we/me can always take the lead and build our own libs and tools – but it’s easier waiting for MS to do the job.
<p>I think that the next step is for MS to take the lead on an existing open source project instead of having others to jump abroad with them. While there are <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/04/18/microsoft_compatability/">many thoughts on the other directions</a>, I think MS is <a href="http://www.newsgeek.co.il/microsoft-open-technologies/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+newsgeekfeed+%28%E2%80%ABNewsgeek%E2%80%AC%29">heading to a good direction</a>. </p>
