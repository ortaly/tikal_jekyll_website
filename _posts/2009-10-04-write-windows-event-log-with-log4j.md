<p>Did anybody tried this ?</p>
<p>I have the configuration file, but when i am running the programm Log4J crashed with NoClassDedFound, without specifying which class.</p>
<p>I suspect it maybe JNI problem - i think i need NTEventLogAppender.dll to be installed on machine. But where do i get one and how to install it ?</p>
