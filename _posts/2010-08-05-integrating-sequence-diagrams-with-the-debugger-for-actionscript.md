<p>Lately I was dealing with a massive refactoring effort in a large scale application. I desperately needed a way to understand the code flow before and after the refactor.</p>
<p><br />
Using the debugger is quite exhausting, and besides, looking at stack trace at a certain point does not reveal the full path of nested calls the runtime went through.</p>
<p><br />
The ideal visualization would be a sequence diagram describing code execution.<br />
Looking for a solution, I discovered several tools that provide this exact functionality.<br />
<a href="http://www.sparxsystems.com/products/ea/index.html">Enterprise Architect </a>and <a href="http://www.architexa.com/learn-more/sequence-diagrams">Architexa </a>are two of them.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But alas, <strong>none of those supports actionscript.</strong></p>
<p><br />
I corresponded with Architexa support, and turns out that they do have ActionScript support prototypes but they are not making it available until they have enough demand for it.</p>
<p><br />
Does anyone know of an existing solution for actionscript?</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,</p>
