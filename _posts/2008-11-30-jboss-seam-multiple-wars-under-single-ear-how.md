<p>I use JBoss Seam for my application.</p><p>Does anyone know is it possible put multiple war files under single EAR?</p><p>Each WAR has it's own <strong>components.xml</strong> and <strong>pages.xml</strong><strong> </strong>in other words there are two separated contexts.</p><p>Moreover I need one, faces driven, WAR,&nbsp; and the second one, is Wicket driven - is it possible ?</p>
