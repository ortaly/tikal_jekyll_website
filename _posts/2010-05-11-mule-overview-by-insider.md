<p>&nbsp;A rare opportunity for all of us to familiarize ourselves with Mule ESB, Mule HQ, and other Mule applications from the developer of MuleSoft. Eugene Berman during his visit to Israel agreed to share his knowledge with all Tikal community. He will cover Mule product line and will leave enough time for our questions on architecture, best practices, common problems, use cases, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Integration is the area where developers and architects most often re-invent the wheel, so this session may reveal that some complex integration problems were already solved and available in this open source suite of tools.</p>

<p>Number of places is limited, hurry to sign up.</p>
