<p>The IGT 2009 conference on Cloud Computing had a workshop on the Erlang programming language. Erlang is widely considered the language of choice for highly concurrent, reliable &amp; scalable applications, e.g., 99.999% up-time middleware servers. It has some amazing features for concurrency, hot-code upgrades, distributed programming &amp;c. BTW, Scala has &quot;borrowed&quot; a lot of features from Erlang.</p>
<p>The workshop was given by Ulf Wigger, the developer of the 1st large commercial product developed in Erlang.</p>

<p>I'm attaching 2 mindmap summaries with notes I took during the workshop.</p>
