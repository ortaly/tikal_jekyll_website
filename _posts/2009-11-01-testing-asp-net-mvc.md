<p>Can someone recomend me a good pattern/fraemworks for testing ASP.NET MVC application?</p>
<p>All samples use controller which does not use it's HttpCopntext. Unfortunately my &quot;real-world&quot; application do use all&nbsp; HttpContext a lot.</p>
<p>I have to simulate HttpContext, and it looks a kind of framework might be created for such puprose.</p>
