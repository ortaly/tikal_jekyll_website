<p>And here is it - another gadget for you, people, that do not have any real social life (being connected to facebook and twitter doesn't count).. <img alt="" src="/sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/regular_smile.gif" /></p>
<p>Do you need a personal companion? a rabbit perhaps?..</p>
<p>You can find it <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com/en/index.html">here</a></p>
<p>He (the rabbit) can read for you (websites, blogs), tell you the news, obey your orders, play radio, communicate with your friends, update you the moment something happens, like for instance .. if your nightly build fails!!</p>
<p>Yes yes, there is a Hudson plugin for it - it's how I found it..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enjoy</p>
<p>the rabbit</p>
