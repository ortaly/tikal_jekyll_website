<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article the author suggests a new way to model the objects of the system such that it is easier to create their database schema in an iterative way (adding new objects/tables as the project moves forward). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;wonder if there's a way in Hibernate to make retrieving such reverse relations easy?</p>
