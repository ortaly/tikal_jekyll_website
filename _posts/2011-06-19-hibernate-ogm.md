<p>&quot;Hibernate Object/Grid Mapper (OGM) aims at providing Java Persistence  (JPA) support for NoSQL solutions. It reuses Hibernate Core's engine but  persists entities into a NoSQL data store instead of a relational  database. It reuses the Java Persistence Query Language (JP-QL) to  search their data.&quot;</p>
