<p><strong>BackGround</strong></p>
<p>Well in most projects today where Virtual Machines, Linux based and Auto-Provisioning, Auto Deployment and Automated system testing is involved</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Build, CI/CD integration</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RPM distribution</strong></p>
<p>rpm distribution is coming more and more common in the cloud era. The majority of projects involving Linux based OS's / images [AMI's as an example] tend to require more and more the ability of <u>instllation, update &amp; rollback</u>. These so called abilities can be easily achived by utlizing a well based system which already exists and is commonly used by System Administrators / DevOps, matter of fact it could be that it is the only string tiying DevOps / SysAdmins to the world of development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RPM's &amp; Debian packadges have been around for a while now and have already established a very solid hold on System Configuration Management, further more Automation / Infrastructure As Code</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Cloud era matures and we found ourselvs continuously building =&gt; releasing =&gt; deploying into and unknown destination we must staderize the way we distribute our artifacts</p>
