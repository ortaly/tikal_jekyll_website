<p>ï»¿I don't know how many of you familiar with this new Google attempt to create new technology that might eventually replace JavaScript.</p>
<p>In the following video&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ka2iDlhBwYM">www.youtube.com/watch</a> you can watch a preview about this technology.</p>
<p>which include among all other regular syntax and rule of programing language new approach for static typing vs dynamic typing. which enable you to have them both in your program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the video they explain way you may need static typing.</p>
<p>I know there is a big argue around this but i think this video is worth seeing, since &nbsp;this technology is being developed from the guys who developed V8 engine.</p>
