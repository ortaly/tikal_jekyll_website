<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard about node.js than you are leaving in a different dimension. The good news you can watch this great talk to get introduced with the subject and learn how this whole integrates into windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, node wasn&rsquo;t planned for windows, better yet, windows wasn&rsquo;t made for node.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Node is an asynchronous JavaScript framework (build on V8 JavaScript engine). The main idea is to enable developers run js code on the server side as well. Why? Because we can and because many developers already know JavaScript and should get the same developer experience as others. Although JavaScript is a single threaded operation you can write asynch code very easily like in many JS UI frameworks that exists today.</p>
