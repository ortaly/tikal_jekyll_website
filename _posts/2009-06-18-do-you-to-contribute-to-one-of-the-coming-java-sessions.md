<p>As discussed on our last company status, we unified the Java server and client groups to &quot;Java group&quot;. We'll have a monthly meeting, in which one of the members will introduce a technical session with Java orientation.<br />
<br />
Since our members have heterogeneous orientations (client ,server and some have both), I suggest we'll have either of the following activities on the meeting :</p>
<ol>
    <li>One of the members will introduce interesting activities on his customer project/product , a research he's done, contribution to open source etc.</li>
    <li>One of the members will introduce a technical topic. Preferable subjects are cross server and client like : Java application on Google App Engine, Seam based application, Cloud Computing and Grid computing, Spring dm server, Dynamic languages on the JVM , Spring Security etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you want to contribute and prepare one of the coming session ?</p>
