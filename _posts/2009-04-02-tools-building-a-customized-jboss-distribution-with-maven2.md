<div dir="ltr">Comrades &amp; Comradettes,<br /><br />During a Maven2 build process I&#39;m building a JBoss customizated running tree - I searched but couldn&#39;t find a repository containing the JBoss distro which I can extract, modify and repackage. Since the developer team is in different locations, I cannot use a shared repository/proxy such as Artifactory, and although this is a one-time process, I don&#39;t want each team member to manually have to install JBoss distro in his local repository.<br />
<br /><b>My Question</b>: Has anyone found a full JBoss (4.2) distribution accessible over a Maven2 repository? Do we, in Tikal, have one on our servers?<br /><br />thanks,<br />Zvika<br /><br /></div>
