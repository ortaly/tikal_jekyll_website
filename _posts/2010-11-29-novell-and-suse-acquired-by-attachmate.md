<p>This is probablly not much interesting to most of our community as I think I'm the only one using opensuse :)&nbsp; But here is another giant acquiring an open source motivated company, Attachmate acquires Novell which puts the SUSE project in an unclear future alltough they promiss they will not kill the suse and opensuse projects.</p>
<p>What's more interesting is that Microtost is somehow involved in this transaction and acquires some intelectual properties from Novell...</p>
