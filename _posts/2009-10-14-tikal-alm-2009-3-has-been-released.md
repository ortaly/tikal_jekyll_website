<p><font size="2">The main issue of this release is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tikal Bugzilla based on latest Bugzilla 3.4</span> with some of the original Tikal Bugzilla enhancements and additional new features.<br />
<br />
This release also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">includes the migration process from Tikal Bugzilla based on 2.20.</span><br />
Since there is no Testopia version that supports Bugzilla 3.4, there is no integration with Testopia for the latest Tikal Bugzilla.<br />
<br />
For more details please see attached Release Notes.</font></p>
