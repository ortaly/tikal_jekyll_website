<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I asked Eucalyptus Systems' Rich Wolski, who helped create the Eucalyptus Software, what companies are doing with the software, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;They're doing a variety of things, but a lot of them are basically interested in Eucalyptus for doing the same kinds of things they're doing in Amazon AWS, such as business logic applications, where part of the attraction of Eucalyptus is that they can use it as a platform for seamlessly running their public cloud applications and their on-premise cloud apps.&quot;</p>
