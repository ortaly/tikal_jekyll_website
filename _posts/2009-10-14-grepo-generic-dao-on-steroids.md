<p>Many of us already know and appreaciate the <a href="https://www.hibernate.org/328.html">Generic DAO design pattern</a>. The &quot;<a href="http://grepo.codehaus.org/index.html">Generic Repository</a>(grepo)&quot; authors took it one step further. Using it, is generally no longer required to provide all the boilerplate code which is necessary in order to access (database) repositories from Java. All you have to do is write appropriate database code (queries, procedures, functions etc.), an appropriately annotated Java interface, and very little Spring configuration.</p>
