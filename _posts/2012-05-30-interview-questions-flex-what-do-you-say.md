<p>Hi all,</p>

<p>as you know, I work as a full time freelancer in RIA and <a href='http://kensodev.com/' title='Web Development'>web development</a>.</p>

<p>Once in a while like every service provider I have to meet with new clients to maybe start working with them on new projects, or work with the company as a consultant.</p>

<p>Usually when I go to this kind of a meeting, my portfolio speaks for itself and we get down to business in no time.</p>

<p>Today was different, I was in such a meeting and the guy sitting with me asked me to take a short test (3 questions test).</p>

<p>It seemed odd, but I didn’t refuse and took it.</p>

<p>Well, I passed :-) he said with flying colors (he’s words), but I wanted to see what you guys think and to see your answers.</p>
<strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>1st Question</span></strong>
<p>Describe all the ways you can send paramaters into a flash object.</p>
<strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>2nd Question</span></strong>
<p>You have an array of zeros and ones 0/1/1/1/1/0/1/0/1/0/1/1/1/0.</p>

<p>Write a function that sorts this array without using the sort function (:-))</p>
<strong><span style='text-decoration: underline;'>3rd Question</span></strong>
<p>You have an XML holding commercial data. Each XmlNode holds the t1 (time to start) and t2 (time to end).</p>

<p>Write a function that takes the commercials and displays them on the canvas. No need to parse the XML.</p>

<p>Time: <strong>15 minutes</strong></p>

<p>I will publish my answers in a different post in a few days. You can either comment or send me the answer via email.</p>
