<p>A major update to my favorite IDE. New features include support of Java 7, Maven 3, git. Java 7 is important, because there were syntax changes (strings in switch statements, diamond operator, etc). Improved support for HTML5. CDI, Bean Validation, JPA and REST last spec updates. The list of features looks impressive taking into account how rarely we see anything really new in Java.</p>
<p>I'm switching, of course.</p>
