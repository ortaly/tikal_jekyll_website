<p>Our next Flex group meeting will focus on how to set up a BlazeDS connection from a Flex app to a Java server. The meeting is not a BlazeDS lecture but rather a step by step demo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can bring your laptops for a hands on experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <span>meeting </span>will be held at Tikal's offices (Habarzel 32A Tel-Aviv), and will be presented by Yossi Shemer (Tikal).</p>
