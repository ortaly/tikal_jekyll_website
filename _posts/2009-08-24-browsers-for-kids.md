<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;KidZui is a revolutionary new kids' browser that makes surfing the Internet fun and easy for kids from ages 3-12. It has over 600,000 kid-friendly websites, photos, and videos. Content is reviewed by teachers and parents so your kids can surf independently. It is a great way to stay in tune with your kids by providing you with weekly e-mails and online reports keeping you up-to-date on your kids'&quot;</p>
