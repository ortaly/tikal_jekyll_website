<p>&nbsp;The new YUI Library (v 3.4) has a new cool website with some cool examples.</p>
<p>One of the examples that caught my attention is a &quot;Todo List&quot; built with JS&nbsp;MVC design pattern style.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the example very much - and I encourage to dive into that and learn the concept through a live working example.</p>
<p>source code is included.</p>
