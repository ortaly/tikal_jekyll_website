<p>This question came to my mind when I saw (finally after couple of days waiting for my Wave account to be ready)&nbsp;the new Google Wave web 2.0 application which is written using GWT technology. I have to say that I'm impressed. I haven't got the chance to fully estimate functionality, but it's definitely a sexy&nbsp;RIA application. Will it give us the missing piece we have always looked for and finally we can say that GWT has a real father (Google)?</p>
