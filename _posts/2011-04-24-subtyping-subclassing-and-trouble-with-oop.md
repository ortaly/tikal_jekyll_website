<p>In the article, the author claims that OOP is not a good way to program since a class that extends another can break the&nbsp; Liskov Substitution Principle. Meaning, it can break existing code, even when the implementation seems sound. The solution is FP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Please don't take it that I personally think that OOP&nbsp;is bad, just posting this article as something disruptive to think about)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning:&nbsp;the article contains C++&nbsp;code...</p>
