<p><em>&quot;this uncertainty doesn&rsquo;t impact enterprise Java, whose future lies elsewhere. We agree with Oracle that enterprise Java has a big future. [...] But Oracle does not own that future. One of the great strengths of Java is its developer and open source community. This is something that cannot be bought in the same way as a PeopleSoft or WebLogic application server business.&quot;</em></p>
