<p>Hi All!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next .NET group meeting (May 1st) will host an <strong>Arduino </strong>presentation, including theory, practice, and some pretty nifty hardware/software projects. This is an opportunity for anyone who haven't been to the previous session to get a glimpse and see what its all about! Meeting in Tikal Offices, 10:00 (earlier if you are a member of the .NET group)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the session we'll be</p>
<p>* Examining some robots</p>
<p>* Meeting exotic musical instruments</p>
<p>* Flying over the Gobi desert with just a Wii controller</p>
<p>and more...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.tikalk.com/events/java-group-meeting-actor-model-scala">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tikalk.com/java/introducing-arduino">here </a>for more information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope to see everyone there!</p>
