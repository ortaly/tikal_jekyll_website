<p><a target="_blank" href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery </a>is a very popular open source java script library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has tones of features, and it supports wide range of browsers. Still, in web based applications, JQuery needs to corporate with ASP.NET server side code, and it would be nice to have some support to it in Visual Studio.</p>
