<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not the first time that I bumped into a customer which has a simple question, why shouldn't I use Java Web Start?</p>
<p>My instinct tells me, don't use it because it's bad for you. Ok, but why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Trying to get an answer</u></p>
<p>Back then I did a little research and I found out that most of the cons were about the end-users experience. You can see couple of example like:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>But why even think of JWS? </u></p>
<p>When you have an existing Swing application and you need a web support you have no choice but to:</p>
<p>1) Develop a web applicaion from scratch.</p>
<p>2) Use Java Web Start</p>
<p>3) Use&nbsp; <a name="http:__www.creamtec.com_products_ajaxswing_solutions_webstart_plugin_pros_cons.html"></a><a target="_blank" href="http://www.creamtec.com/products/ajaxswing/solutions/webstart_plugin_pros_cons.html">AJAX Swing</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My question is, what if I only have couple of users and they have no problem with Java, should I cosider JWS as my best solution? </strong></p>
