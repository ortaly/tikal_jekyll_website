<p>New blog post!</p>

<p>Excerpt:</p>

<p>When working on a large scale application, eventually you&rsquo;ll want to break it down to one or more product sub projects that all depend on a common project.</p>

<p>This post will discuss how to&nbsp;work with 2 projects properly while still using bower to manage dependencies</p>
