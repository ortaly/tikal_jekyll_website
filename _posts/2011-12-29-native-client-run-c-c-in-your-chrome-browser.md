<p>This is an overview of the native-client library, already implemented in Chrome (so the document says, their link to the app-gallery returns 404). It allows to write C/C++ code that will run in a sandbox in the browser in a cross-platform, secure, way. Javascript can communicate with the C/C++&nbsp;module. This allows to write web applications that require portions of CPU&nbsp;intensive code. It may also open up the door for more languages being supported &quot;natively&quot;&nbsp;in the browser. </p>
