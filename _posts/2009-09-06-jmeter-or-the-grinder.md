<p>JMeter was my first and current choice, I haven't tried out any other applications when it comes to load testing.</p>
<p>I bumped into this <a onclick="window.open(this.href,'','resizable=no,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no,fullscreen=no,dependent=no,status'); return false" href="http://rrees.wordpress.com/2009/04/09/jmeter-or-the-grinder-so-which-one-is-better-like/">BLog</a>, its writer is trying to see which one is better (from the Grinder side) JMeter or the Grinder.</p>
<p>The reason I was a bit curious about The Grinder is because <a onclick="window.open(this.href,'','resizable=no,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no,status=no,toolbar=no,fullscreen=no,dependent=no,status'); return false" href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=57463">GrinderStone 2.0.1 is released</a>, I hope I'll have some spare time to check it out.</p>
