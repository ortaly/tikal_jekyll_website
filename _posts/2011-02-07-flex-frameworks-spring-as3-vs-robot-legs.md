<p>The March Flex group event is a show-down!</p>
<p>On the left corner, Yossi (the injector) Shemer will present an overview of SpringAS and on the right corner Vlad Vladislav (C-3PO) Musienko will present Robot Legs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Definitely not a session you'd want to miss! May the best (tech nerd) man will!</p>
<p>This is, as always, an open session, venue is 4, Habarzel St, Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please register if you plan to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Update:</strong></u></p>
<p>Original date was March 31st but due to technical reasons this event was postponed to April 14th.</p>
<p>venue remained the same.</p>
