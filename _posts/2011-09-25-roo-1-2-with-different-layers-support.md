<p>This is really impressing! They created a full application with several entites on MongoDb, and deployed it to Cloud Foundry. In less than 50 lines of Roo commands from an empty dir to the application deployed on CloudFoundry.com. Actually, in less than 40 lines, if you don't count comments and empty lines :) I don't think even Jango would allow the same with less than 40 lines of script and code combined.</p>
