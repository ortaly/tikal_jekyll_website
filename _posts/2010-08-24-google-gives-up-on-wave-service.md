<p>Quoted from NT Times website Aug 9th 2010:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;On  Wednesday, Google said that it would stop developing Wave as a  standalone product and that the Web site could be shuttered by the end  of the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technology will remain available if people want  to develop new tools with it.  Despite having ''numerous loyal fans,  Wave has not seen the user adoption we would have liked,'' Urs Holzle,  senior vice president of operations at Google, wrote in a company blog  post. &quot;</p>
