<p class="MsoNormal">Alt.Net tools night are great for &ldquo;getting to know&rdquo; new tools and meet some outstanding fellow .Net (or other) programmers/professionals. Usually around 60 or so people come to these events and I think this is pretty impressive for a Google group that started out there in the wild.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the last session of Alt.Net tools night (Jan 2012) I got so impressed by one of the sessions I decided to share it. Not that the other session where unimpressive, on the contrary, it&rsquo;s just that this little tool is not something you see every day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You don&rsquo;t get to see to amazing talented people quit their day job and lay it all down from a basic concept to a real product just to give it a shot in the wild like the big boys play. And they have done a fantastic job with a great tool: <a href="http://www.bugaidsoftware.com/">BugAid</a>. BugAid is debug helper integrated into VS 2010. It gives you a better insight of what you are debugging. Here are some samples I just copied and paste <a href="http://www.bugaidsoftware.com/features/">from their site</a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-no-proof:yes"><img width="798" height="106" border="0" src="/files/Boolean Expression Aid.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-no-proof:yes"><img width="397" height="104" border="0" src="/files/Return Method Aid.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Get the output of each and every code segment right where the code is written</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-no-proof:yes"><img width="507" height="254" border="0" src="/files/Start Debug.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-no-proof:yes"><img border="0" src="/files/Search Debug.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Search&amp; filter <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>you debug watch item instead of just viewing long enumeration values.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-no-proof:yes"><img border="0" src="/files/Search Debug and Star.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Star your important members</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-no-proof:yes"><img width="591" height="244" border="0" src="/files/Compare Vars.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Compare variables and variables snapshot</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The good news they are giving <a href="http://www.bugaidsoftware.com/2012/01/bugaid-is-free-for-non-commercial-open-source-projects/">free license if are an official open source programmer</a>, that means you have to send them a link to your project in order to get the free license. They are also selling a license for 49$ - but get this: you will receive all future updates, free of charge since this is an early adopter program.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All n all, I think that this kind of tool should be fully integrated with the next version of VS. These guys had a great Idea and where able to bring it from a mere thought to a working product.</p>
