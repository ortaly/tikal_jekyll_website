<p>We will have a short overview presentation of what's new, followed by a showcase on how a simple game can be implemented once in a common lib project and used in multiple versions / platforms - be it the AIR desktop, FLEX web or Android mobile.</p>
<p>Main focus will be on the Android mobile version of the game, to show how basic things are done a bit differently when developing for mobile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you all there!</p>
