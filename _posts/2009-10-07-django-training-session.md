<p>Next monday (12-oct) I'm doing a training session on Python &amp; Django, organized by some open-source group. It's intended to give people a real feel of what's it like to develop in Python &amp; Django &amp; will contain both lecture &amp; hands-on exercises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event is open to everyone, but you must register, in either:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will probably be more such sessions coming later (got many requests for training from Tikal &amp; Verint employees), but they're not scheduled yet.</p>
