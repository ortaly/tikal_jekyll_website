<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>i am trying to configure JXM console on Ubuntu and (as usuall) encountered some strange behavior.</p>
<p>It works on my machine :)</p>
<p>it doesn't work on remote server, neither it works on other Itais' laptop.</p>
<p>Hostname and host IP configuration are correct (similar) on all 3 machines.</p>
<p>JVM version, however are a bit different 1.6.06 (the one that works on my machine) 1.6.012 and 1.6.014 the ones that don't work.</p>
<p>Any suggestions ?</p>
