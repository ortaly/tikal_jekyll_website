<p>A while ago when JavaFX released its first version I wrote a little <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tikalk.com/java/blog/javafx-it-ready-rock">Blog</a> about it.</p>
<p>Today I was looking for some good news about JavaFX, but still it looks like after releasing version 1.2 <a target="_blank" href="http://canoo.com/blog/2009/06/04/j1-session-blog-pro-javafx-platform-ria-enterprise-application-development-with-javafx-technology/">JavaFX is a&nbsp; disappointment</a>. It will take some time until it'll be ready for heavy duty enterprise applications.<br />
RIA framework are sprouting everywhere... why should we wait for JavaFX to be ready? <br />
I don't see why, do you?</p>
