<p>Many of you know IronPyton and IronRuby</p>
<p>You have to add to this Iron list one more - <a href="http://github.com/fholm/IronJS">IronJS</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;IronJS is a JavaScript implementation built on top of the <a href="http://dlr.codeplex.com/">Dynamic Language Runtime</a> from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> which allows you to embed  a javascript runtime into yor .NET applications. The current state of  the code is at best alpha quality.&quot;</p>
