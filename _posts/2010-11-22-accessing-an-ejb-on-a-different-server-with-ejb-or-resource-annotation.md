<p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have EJBs deployed on a Glassfish server and I&nbsp;have a Servlet accessing them from another server (which is also a Glassfish server). Of course it's possible to look it by using JNDI lookup, but is there a way to look it up by using an annotation? So far I haven't found an example for this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
