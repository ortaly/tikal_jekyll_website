<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure some of you got this exception before :)</p>
<p>i was wondering maybe we could discuss this issue, in order to know what is the best way to solve this jsf problem</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read about few solutions for javax.faces.application.ViewExpiredException</p>
<p>one is to catch it, in the web xml,&nbsp; and navigate to login page -&gt; i tried that, but still the page isn&#39;t being fully reRendered and continue surfing isnt possible unless closing the browser and reopen it.</p>
<p>the second solution is phaselistener --&gt; doesn&#39;t work for me also, session is not being fully terminated..</p>
<p>any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
