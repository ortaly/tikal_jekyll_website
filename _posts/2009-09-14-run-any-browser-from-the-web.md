<p>This is truly working... If you need to test your application at various browsers, now you can use <a href="http://www.spoon.net/browsers">Spoon Browser Sandbox</a>.</p>
<p>With no Installation or special preparations you can run almost any available browser.</p>
<p>The big con I can see is, well of course big no for Linux.</p>
<p>I have tested it for a while looks like it really works.</p>
