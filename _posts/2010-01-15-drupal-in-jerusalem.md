</ol>
<p>This meetup - hopefully first in a series - is to give students, staff and interested Yerushalmim, an introduction to the Open source/ Drupal community and the means at their disposal.</p>
<p>If all goes well we may replicate this meetup in another college, university and high school.  <br />
You can participate in presenting and/or organizing a meetup in your city. <br />
The Linux community is assisting by providing the hall/classroom.</p>
<p>The background for the initiative: <br />
About three years ago I figured &quot;Open source&quot; to be a marginal trend in the programming world. <br />
I still meet knowledgeable persons - young as well - who know even less than I did at the time.  <br />
Today I'm aware this is the community that is leading and providing means to all for the silent revolution that knows no borders.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the Jerusalem Linux Club.</p>
