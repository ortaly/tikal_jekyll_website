<p>impress.js is another example of the powerfull use of javascript+html5+css3. It is a clone of <a href="http://prezi.com">prezi</a>. This means, it is a presentation tool where the flow is not through slides, but through zomming&nbsp;(focusing) on different parts of a large canvas. The steps are defined in HTML and the javascript package handles the transition. This means, authoring the presentation can be done in whatever HTML&nbsp;editor and not limited to a small subset of tools, as in prezi</p>
