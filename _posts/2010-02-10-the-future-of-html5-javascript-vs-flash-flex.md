<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">I believe that HTML5 + JavaScript are the future. The reasons are mostly&nbsp;
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">1. Support (flash isn't always supported, e.g. RedHat Linux).&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">2. Expertise - easier to find/ develop HTML/JavaScript expertise.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">3. Cost - decent flex development requires a good IDE, and these cost money.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">4. Adaption by the market - today you already have JavaScript/CSS libraries that support HTML 5.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">5. Shorter/easier development cycle (impossible to debug a flash object on a remote server).</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">6. Integration with the server side (take for example Gad's last community entry about Flex+Seam).</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">7. Flex is no longer the only solution for live media.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">8. With &lt;canvas/&gt; you can get great presentation like here:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" style="color: rgb(85, 26, 139); " href="http://scripty2.com/">http://scripty2.com/</a></div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">I don't have any hands on experience with HTML5, but from what I understand, it is an extension to HTML, allowing you to do stuff you couldn't do with old HTML by adding more tags, but use the same concept of mixture of pages which reside on the server side which contain code which produces something which can be interpreted by the browser + javascript which runs on the client side.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">If that is still the case, then I might agree that this is the future for&nbsp;<b>web developers</b>, as oppose to&nbsp;<b>developers</b>.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">The way I see it, web developers is a special breed of developers, which feel comfortable with this unintuitive development experience of the ui created on the server and being passed to client. writing a line of conditional code on the server to be interpreted on the client is not intuitive. A web developer is always aware of what code is being run on which side.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">When I was involved in web applications (<a target="_blank" href="http://ASP.NET/">ASP.NET</a>) I always needed a web developer besides me.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">As oppose, when developing a Flex application, your common development skills of object oriented/event driven programming are 100% valid. You program like a desktop, but it runs on the web. You have everything you need in your fat client, and only gets data from the server.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">I just talked to one of our customers who is an experienced web developer &nbsp;and he feels the same. He also mentioned lack of good javascript IDE (how come? javascript is around for such a long time).</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">Given the additional elements of HTML5, he still feels that he would prefer Flex.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">This is my general feeling. To be specific to the points raised by Adi, I added comments below.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">That said, in case you tell me that you can develop massive applications with javascript, with classes, event handling, good layout mechanisms, effect libraries, easy customization of UI components and it will only require my desktop development experience, I wouldn't mind use it. Some say that Action script is very similar to javascript, who knows ?&nbsp;</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">The major problem of HTML5 is standard support between browsers. It is easier to support features by a proprietary company then get an agreement of several companies which all want to differentiate themselves.</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">Easier to make a Flex developer from a developer, then a web developer from a developer.</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">Maybe this is the reason for the lack of good javascript IDE? Flex customers are usually corporates which consider this cost as a good ROI.</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">So? Today you have flex adopted by very large corporates as their preferred technology for B2B applications. And this trend is on the rise as other corporates see the benefits of this technology.</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">Yo are kidding, right? shorter development cycle?? intuitive programming model leads to shorter development cycle. And you can debug Flex applications emotely if compiled to being debugged. you just point your IDE to run the application in the remote server.</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">This is hardly the reason for major corporates for choosing Flex. None of the applications I developed used any kind of media, and still Flex was chosen.</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">HTML 5 is a standard! Not extension. Except for IE which is on its way there - all major browsers already support it. And speaking about standards - the Flash engines on IE and Firefox behave differently. The acknowledgments send from the flash engine to the server (in terms of hand-shaking are different. we had to modify our code to handle this)</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">The point is that once the server side gets more involved then stateless HTTP request/response you start to feel the lack of integration.

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">You're right. But I was referring to the small portion of applications (or web sites) that chose flash for these capabilities. For example:&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://deezer.com/">deezer.com</a>&nbsp;- the whole site is written using HTML and JavaScript aside for the music related parts. This is no longer necessary. Think of it - in terms of resources - the same web developers that created the major part of the site can not facilitate standard HTML/JavaScript to do the rest. No need for Adobe tech.</div>

<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">Finally - I'm not against Flex. I'm using it with great satisfaction. It's far from being perfect but that's because there's no magic. Nothing is perfect!&nbsp;</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">What I was trying to say is that they're on to some really challenging fight against the new features of HTML/JavaScript, and as it looks today - they won't necessarily win. It doesn't mean it will vanish from this world. Not at all! Flex/Flash will always be there. The question is in what volume.</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">Lot's of it depends on how Adobe reacts to their developers community demands...</div>
<div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; ">BTW, If you want to present a Java/Flex backing argument, you can always give SpringSource as an example. They made integration with flex part of their platform and (this is important) they have an IoC (Spring for Flex) framework developed.</div>
