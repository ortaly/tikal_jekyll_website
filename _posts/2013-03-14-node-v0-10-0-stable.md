<p>Node v10.10.0 (Stable) has been released this week with a focus on an improved &quot;Stream&quot; API called &quot;Stream2&quot;. &nbsp;This is a major change since a lot of the Node APIs rely on &quot;Stream2&quot;</p>
<p>Another&nbsp;interesting insight is the upcoming releases: v0.12 will focus on improving&nbsp;the HTTP (which is already quite good) and the long waited for <strong>v1.0</strong> -&nbsp;&nbsp;which will not have many changes in regards of day-to-day operations but will rather mark a significant milestone in terms of stability.&nbsp;</p>
