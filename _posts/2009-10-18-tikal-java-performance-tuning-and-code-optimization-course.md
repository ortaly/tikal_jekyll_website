<p>Java performance tuning and code optimization workshop<br />
<br />
Hi all, <br />
We are considering offering a new hands-on workshop titled &quot;Java performance tunning and Java code optimization&quot;. It is meant to cover a diverse array of topics ranging from basic java code optimizations to tunning large scale JVMs, heaps and application servers (Jboss, tomcat) on multi-core CPUs. <br />
<br />
An attempt would be made to introduce the most frequently used tools for JVM profiling and monitoring such as jstat, jconsole, jhat, jproiler/yourkit etc etc while presenting a real world example to demonstrate and discuss the tools and issues raised.<br />
<br />
In order to find out if the number of participants is going to large enough to justify opening this workshop, i ask anyone who is really considering attending the class to reply and if possible add the topics that he would like to be presented with during the workshop. <br />
<br />
The details are not finalized yet but I expect the workshop to span several sessions. <br />
<br />
The speakers of the workshop will be me (Shlomo) and I might be able to recruit some other talent for that from the Tikal team.<br />
