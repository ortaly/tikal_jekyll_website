<p><strong>The java threading is obviously the best of the threading paradigms we have!</strong><br />
<br />
(Now I squeeze my ears to avoid the loud and uncontrollable, sometimes even hateful reaction)<br />
<br />
They just bark : &ldquo;Scala is the right threading, you will do better with Scala&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
Ok..Ok..<strong>Relax...</strong><br />
<br />
You can call that wrapper a language and fully enjoy it .<br />
<br />
But somebody, even more skeptic than me has said: &ldquo;Java is a C and an Assembly wrapper, so why it is a language and scala is not?&rdquo;<br />
<br />
I appreciate all those comments and have a right to completely ignore them.<br />
Yes.</p>
<p><br />
That is because C is such uncomfortable to code, such OS dependent and Scala is so a black wrapper box, that my best practical feelings are still on the java side. And I completely disagree with a latest Jbug agenda &ldquo;Is Java a productivity dead end?&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
I left the forum with the strongest&nbsp; and unapologetic confidence: java&rsquo;s death is yet to be fantasized in wet dreams of some python masochist!<br />
<br />
Looking at site builders and templates creators work I have no problem &ndash; go ruby, go python, go any animal you know!&nbsp; (BTW, the simplest shopping card in Django&nbsp; is yet to mature, checked&hellip;) <br />
<br />
In domain of miraculous concurrency and in domain of controllable changes and in domain of vendors supported solutions I have that confidence: Java is a way to go. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;Although I fully appreciate the scala&rsquo;s message driven threading like a best practice to play in the concurrent world! Yes , I do.&nbsp; I still feel a lack of vendor&rsquo;s appreciation, a lack of integration and more: I feel I do <strong>something, that somebody somehow</strong> translates<strong> to some</strong> unknown byte code. Brrrr..... <br />
<br />
You right, we can&rsquo;t&nbsp; completely control a native thread in Java on the lowest level , but we have a years of experience in java thread control, that is enough for most of tasks.<br />
<br />
I think scala, ruby, python,&nbsp; php, etc&hellip; all have heir niches, but to say &ldquo;java is a dead end!!!&rdquo; is to cheat themselves. <br />
<br />
BTW: for the beast sake:&nbsp; who likes those cumbersome and ugly expressions!!!??? And why it so problematic to create getters and setters, if anyway in any complex business application you have to modify their defaults?</p>
<p><br />
Java is optimal between the freak C masochist choice and .Net girls innocence........</p>
<p><br />
Although I fully confirm that fact - different languages improve our overall experience...</p>
<p>Whether it practical or not??? Chineese does much better in realm of intelligence practice, I'm sure.</p>
<p><br />
I like your comments , buddies,&nbsp; even if they are all offensive&hellip;as I can expect.</p>
