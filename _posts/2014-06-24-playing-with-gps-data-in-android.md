<p>No doubt that location data can add value to almost any mobile app today, not only to navigation apps. For example, you don&#39;t have to remember or write where you take each photo, and if you search for a resturant you&#39;d see only places near by.</p>

<p>We made a simple app that record movements and sends data about the track to twitter (if you don&#39;t tell everyone, why bother?)</p>
