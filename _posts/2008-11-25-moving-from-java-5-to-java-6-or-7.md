<p> </p><p>Hi all,</p> <p>We have a client that wants to move from java 5, and doesn't know if he should upgrade to java 6 or java 7.</p> <p>Zvika posted a while ago a link to an interesting article that suggests skipping on java 6 and moving straight to java 7:</p> <p><a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/link/32737">http://www.sdtimes.com/link/32737</a></p> <p>What do you think? Would you skip java 6 and move straight to java 7?</p> <p>Note that the reason the client wants to upgrade is mainly performance (after they fine-tuned the GC and upgraded to the latest jboss).</p> <p>Thanks,</p> <p>Elad</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
