<p>A very informative and motivational talk about writing readalbe, maintainable javascript code.</p>
<p>I took few good tips from this talk: stick to community code conventions, use documentation generator as part of the build process, document when you can (stick to &quot;always&quot;).</p>
<p>Oh yeah, if you watch till the end - that last slide (actually one before the last) with the quote is <strong>very important</strong>.</p>
