<p>After declaring the opening of the category - <a href='http://www.kensodev.com/category/link-bag/' title='Link Bag'>Link Bag</a>, the first post is fresh and hot out of the oven. <h2>CSS</h2> <a href='http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites-workflow/' target='_blank'>CSS sprites workflow</a> - Chris Coyier posted a very useful tip about the workflow of creating a website when you plan to use sprite css, he suggests a two-step process. <h2>Freelancing</h2> <a href='http://freelanceswitch.com/inspiration/are-you-giving-back-to-your-community/' target='_blank'>Are You Giving Back to Your Community?</a> - FreelanceSwitch with another great post. I actually posted on a very similar subject here ”<a href='http://www.kensodev.com/2010/08/03/should-all-developers-be-members-of-the-virtual-community/'>should all developer be (active) members in the virtual community</a>.”</p>
