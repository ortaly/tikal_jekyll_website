<p>&quot;Apple will contribute most of the key components, tools and technology        required for a Java SE 7 implementation on Mac OS X, including a 32-bit        and 64-bit HotSpot-based Java virtual machine, class libraries, a        networking stack and the foundation for a new graphical client. OpenJDK        will make Apple's Java technology available to open source developers so        they can access and contribute to the effort.&quot;</p>
