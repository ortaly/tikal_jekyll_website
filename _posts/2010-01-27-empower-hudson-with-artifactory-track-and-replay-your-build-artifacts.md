<p>Interesting post that introduces Hudson-Artifactory integration:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.jfrog.org/2009/12/empower-hudson-with-artifactory-track.html">blogs.jfrog.org/2009/12/empower-hudson-with-artifactory-track.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artifactory is definitely more than just Maven repository manager, the option of having build info together with deployed artifacts can be very useful.</p>
<p>Although there are differences between the open source version and the commercial version of Build Integration in Artifactory, we should consider Artifactory as a replacement for Nexus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is also a wiki page for Artifactory Build Integration:&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.jfrog.org/confluence/display/RTF/Build+Integration">wiki.jfrog.org/confluence/display/RTF/Build+Integration</a></p>
