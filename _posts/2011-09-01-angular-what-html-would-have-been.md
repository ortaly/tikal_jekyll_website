<p>Angular is (another) MVC&nbsp;framework for Javascript.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It uses the HTML&nbsp;as a template, adding attributes to add dynamic rendering to elements (similar to wicket/tapestry/kid). It supports two way databinding between form elements and javascript functions. It also supports dependency injection with autowiring.</p>
