<p>Does any one know - does NTLMv2 supported in java 6 on linux.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to connect to site using NTLMv2 authentication only. On windows it works and uses current logged user as principal.</p>
<p>On linux I get reject from target site.</p>
<p>I use sun jre http client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: NTLM works but NTLMv2 not.</p>
<p>I cant use&nbsp; third party like JCIFS, Oakland</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
