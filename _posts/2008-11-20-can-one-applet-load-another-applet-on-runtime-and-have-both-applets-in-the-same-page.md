<p>I want to have two frames in a page. In one frame there will be the first applet which will load automatically when the page is loaded. And the other frame will contain a blank page. Now when the first applet initialize the second applet it will give the blank page (second frame) as parameter.<br />Is someone familiar with that?</p>
