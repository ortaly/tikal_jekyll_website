<p>&nbsp;I guess that since the acquisition of Sun, and as result MySQL AB, by Oracle every MySQL user had wonder if Oracle is a good hosting place to Open Source like MySQL.&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically I am optimistic regarding the future of MySQL, but I think the community should stay alert and make sure Oracle know how match we care for MySQL.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am attaching a link to a post by Michael &quot;Monty&quot; Widenius, the creator of MySQL where he states his fears regarding the upcoming for MySQL and ask your support.</p>
