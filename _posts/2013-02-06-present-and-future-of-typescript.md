<p>i've been going through the TypeScript documentations and found this JS extension very appealing; for a big project, such as a serious one-page web-app, i'd love to use the expressiveness of TS.... However, it came from the house of M$, which makes me worried, since they tend to make things tricky, at least in the sense of adherence to openess, standards and all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'd love to see a discussion about TypeScript, a discussion that will help decide whether to adopt it or not.</p>
