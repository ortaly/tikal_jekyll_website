<p>Our goal for the first Fuse day was to start working with the new  framework and these were our achievements by the end of the day:<br />
- Added a tab (plugin) for Hudson - went pretty smooth!<br />
- Added plugin that handles  Hudson integration with Bugzilla inside the framework - replace the link to  Bugzilla created by Hudson Bugzilla plugin with the link to Bugzilla  inside the ALM2 - still have some problems that need to be fixed.<br />
- Added Tikal header as a plugin - also have some problems that still  need to be fixed.<br />
- Add dashboard &quot;boxes&quot; for existing components -  just started with the one of the &quot;boxes&quot;.<br />
- &quot;How to add a plugin&quot;  document for &quot;tab&quot; plugins<br />
Although we had a nice progress with the planned items, the conclusion  was that some changes should be done in the framework to make it simpler  to work with, like use static (pluggable) tabs, remove use of  spring-javaconfig and etc.<br />
<br />
I'd like to thank to all participants and  organizers of this day, it was very productive and fun! :)</p>
