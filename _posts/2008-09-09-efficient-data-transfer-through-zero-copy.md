<p>In this article they show how to transfer data from file to socket in a way that no buffer copying is taking place (hence zero copy). Actually, the data even is not accessible in user space with this technique.</p><p>Also includes benchmarks at the end of the article, comparing different transfer methods.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
