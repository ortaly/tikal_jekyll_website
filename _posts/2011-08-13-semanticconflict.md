<p>&quot;Those who hear my colleagues and I talk about   <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html" target="_blank">FeatureBranch</a> know that we're not big fans of that   pattern. An important part of our objection is the observation that   branching is easy, but merging is hard. One argument we hear from   time to time is that modern <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/VersionControlTools.html" target="_blank">VersionControlTools</a> make   merging sufficiently easy that feature branching is worthwhile.&quot;</p>
