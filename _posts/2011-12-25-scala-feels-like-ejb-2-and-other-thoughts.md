<p><a href="http://blog.joda.org/2011/11/scala-feels-like-ejb-2-and-other.html">This</a> blog entry came to my attention from reading a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/saylambda/">lambda group</a> post by <a href="http://narkisr.com/">Ronen Narkis</a>, and this was my reply:</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); "><em>Few days ago I twitted this:  &quot;ok, i admit. #Scala actually sucks...&quot;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); "><em>I didn't read the blog yet (I will though) but if I have to sum up what I think about Scala in one short sentence then it would be: &quot;Yet another lab creation&quot;. Exactly like the early version of EJB. It's obvious that it isn't a community driven development. It has nothing to do with developer convenience nor pleasure. It feels like it was created for pure academic purpose. I have tons of other stuff to say about Scala but I don't want to wear you guys out...</em><br />
