<p>The client I work for needs add external tracing to java methods using aspect approach. Desired methods should be configured from external configuration file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Application runs on JBoss</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracing should print input parameters (even complex data structures) and return value.</p>
<p>Are there any ready open source libraries ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can write JBoss interceptor, but it covers only jboss managed beans.</p>
