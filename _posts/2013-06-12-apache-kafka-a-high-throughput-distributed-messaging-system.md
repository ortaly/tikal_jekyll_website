<p>Did you hear about Kafka? That writer with his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_(novel)">castle</a>, beurocratic monster, sending messages here and there? He probably inspired these guys to build something that would help with all those messages. The same named messaging system powers up Linked In and Tumblr. Hundreds of thousands of messages on a modest hardware for a messaging system written in Scala - sounds impressive, no?</p>
