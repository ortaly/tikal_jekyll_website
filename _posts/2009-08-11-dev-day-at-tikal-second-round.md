<p>Hi All,</p>
<p><br />
After listening to all comments for the <a href="http://www.tikalk.com/alm/forums/dev-day-tikal">previous Dev-Day post</a>, we've decided today on the tech meeting on the following points:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The format for the dev-day will be 1 hour session followed by &ldquo;hands-on&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>We will use several technologies which integrates with JVM, but not necessary pure Java language only.</li>
    <li>The work will be with pairs sitting on one laptop &ndash; We think that heterogeneous pairs would be great (i.e. one &ldquo;server&rdquo; developer and one &ldquo;client&rdquo; developer).</li>
    <li>We will concentrate on technologies, rather on business. So we will reuse and enrich the same application on our meeting.</li>
    <li>All team will develop the same application above, and the chosen application will be used for Tikal-Fuse (repository of sample applications). We make use of this repository on our kick-off projects as well as training sessions.</li>
    <li>All artifacts will be saved on source control repository.</li>
    <li>The chosen application is a very simple CRUD application for managing sample applications. An example of such a application can be seen on sample application <a href="http://examples.extjs.eu/">at ExtJS sample site</a>.</li>
    <li>The first dev-day will concentrate on building the application with technologies Spring/Hibernate on the server and Flex on the client. We can use several binding options, but in my opinion it would be great to use <a href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-flex">Spring-BlazeDS</a></li>
    <li>We will use Maven2 as our build mechanism. IDE is free to choose.</li>
    <li>We'll expect start our first dev-day on September.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any more improvements suggestions/ recommendations are more than welcome...<br />

Thank you</p>
