<p><a target="_blank" href="http://visitmix.com">Mix Online</a> is a very nice community web site for web developers. It contains several open source prototypes we can use as a starter for our projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A very nice project is <a target="_blank" href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/glimmer">Glimmer, which can be downloaded from Code Plex</a>. <strong>Glimmer </strong>is a &quot;<strong>JQuery Interactive Design Tool</strong>&quot;. In real people language it means that this is a desktop application that allows you to build JQuery scripts without coding. This is a shortcut for JQuery newcomers.</p>
