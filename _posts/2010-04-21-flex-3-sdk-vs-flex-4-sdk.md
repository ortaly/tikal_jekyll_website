<p>Now that Flex SDK 4 was released, I thought I'd do a series of posts on the differences between Flex 3 and Flex 4 SDKs that will hopefully help migrate your Flex 3 app to Flex 4 or make the transition from SDK 3 to SDK 4 easier. I will be assuming you already know Flex 3 and will concentrate on the new in Flex 4 compared to Flex 3.</p>
<p>This post will serve as the index of the series, and I will be adding links to the different posts to this one as they become available, so come back from time to time to get updated.</p>
