<p>&nbsp;Plugs into Eclipse to enable running tests immediately on file save, and to mark the failed tests like compilation errors. Another interesting feature - dynamic ordering of the tests so the new, recently fixed and quick tests run first, and slow tests are run the last. This way the developer gets the feedback on his changes as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
