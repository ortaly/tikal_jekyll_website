<p>A real <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/maggieshiels/2010/06/the_open_source_entrepreneur.html">interesting read</a> I ran into, See selected quotes which triggered my cuiriousity:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't until I got involved in this open-source model that I  realised the problem is the hardware guys all shared their knowledge  while the software guys were hoarding knowledge. They were not sharing  and as a result the software did not evolve forward very quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It wasn't until I got involved in this open-source model that I  realised the problem is the hardware guys all shared their knowledge  while the software guys were hoarding knowledge. They were not sharing  and as a result the software did not evolve forward very quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't sure there was a real business here until I was in the  audience when Scott (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_McNealy">Scott McNealy</a>) was expounding on how evil Microsoft was with the  monopolies that they owned in desktop operating systems and productivity  tools, and he said 'what are your alternatives?'<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&quot;He was  pushing <a href="http://www.java.com/en/">Java</a> and he was saying  your alternatives were: you can continue to pay homage to Microsoft, or  you can always use this free open-source software, or you can use my  Java solution.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&quot;The punchline of course being we should all use  Java. But what was hugely informative to me was I thought no-one was  paying any attention to this <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">open  software</a> thing and here is one of the most successful guys in  technology dismissing it as unimportant.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&quot;I suddenly go 'holy  cow!' Not a single major billion-dollar company takes this seriously. I  know all these propeller-heads who think it is the right thing to do,  this sure looks like an opportunity to me. And so, by being as contrary  as I am, Scott got me on the right path.&quot;</p>
