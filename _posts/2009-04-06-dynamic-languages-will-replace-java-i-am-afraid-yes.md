<p>Well, After hearing allot from all the smart guys at Tikal and outside, you should look at dynamic languages...</p>
<p>I started to dive a little bit into the domain and I must admit I think all &quot;I told you&quot; guys are right!</p>
<p>The main reason it's now is, most of developers are feed up of the cycle of &quot;compile-package-deploy&quot;, they just want the &quot;compile-deploy&quot; cycle. (and yes, I am familiar with <a href="/community/clientside/userlink/javarebel-brings-class-reloading-java">JavaRebel</a> )</p>
<p>The big question is which language / technology to pick?</p>
<p><strong>Python ?</strong> I was amazed of the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> framework presentation Udi from BeeTV gave us, the framework and the language is easy and extensible not only at the front-end but also at back-end (could replace spring and hibernate DAO at glance).<br />
But the big problem is with Django is we probably will start a new project from scratch with it, not suitable to old and new code mash-ups.</p>
<p><strong>Ruby ?</strong> well I didn't get into much details here yet, but I did attend Adi great presentation of RubyOnRails, he just did the magic and we had a new application in minutes. but as most of us know, ruby has some flaws in terms of multi platform and performance.</p>
<p>I heard about Scala and Errlang before, but didn't pay attention to them at all, till Adi sent me today this link <a href="http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html"><strong><span class="ts">Twitter on Scala</span></strong></a></p>
<p>Well the main reason I writing this post is, I have just learned nor Ruby or Python have <em>&quot;an environment for long lived processes. But the JVM is very good at that, because it&rsquo;s been optimized for that over the last ten years&quot;</em><br />
<strong>It's mean Java could be replaced with other language, but the JVM is here to stay!</strong></p>
<p>Well, probably I didn't covered all the details, but if someone want to add more info please, do, I just wanted to share you all we should start thinking about the next wave...</p>
