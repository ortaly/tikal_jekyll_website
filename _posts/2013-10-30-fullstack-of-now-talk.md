<p>On 29/10/2013, I gave a talk about fullstack development with javascript.</p>

<p>The talk was part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/full-stack-developer-il/">Fullstack Developers Israel</a> Meetup Group.</p>

<p>For years since its inception,Javascript was living in the shadow of big technology players such as Java and Flash (Macromedia and later - Adobe). Throughout the years, Javascript and html (and later the standard of html5) gained popularity with the strong support form big players - Google, Mozilla and Apple - which lead a certain popularity in server development as well - along with the release of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>.</p>
