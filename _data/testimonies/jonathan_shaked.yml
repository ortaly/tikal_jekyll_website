  that working in Tikal is like no other place.\r\nMy past couple of years as Tikal's
  sales manager, are a great experience, on both the professional and personal aspects.\r\nI
  found the ONE place which truly stands behind the overused statement of 'integrating
  work and hope' (and this I can say as a father to 4 kids who really needs such integration
  :)\r\nI found true friends among my colleagues in Tikal, and for me it's one of
  the major factors in choosing my work place.\r\nLast and not least, my professional
  integrity- as a sales manager, its a key factor in my engagement with customers,
  and here again I can easily say that I go to sleep, every night, in peace with my
  integrity, knowing that I can fully stand behind the quality of the service that
  we at Tikal provide."
