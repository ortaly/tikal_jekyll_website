A new beta has been released of the `jekyll-import` gem! This beta has been
completely reworked from the inside out and is now setup to work perfectly with
future versions of Jekyll, which will use the [`mercenary` gem][mercenary].

This new version also adds support for the following importers:

- [jrnl][]
- [Joomla][] 3.x

A plethora of bugfixes as well &emdash; enjoy!
