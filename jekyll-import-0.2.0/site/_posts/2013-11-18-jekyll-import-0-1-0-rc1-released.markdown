We're finally nearing a full release of `jekyll-import`! This release has some
critical bug fixes as well as some awesome enhancements.

**NOTE:** This version does not work with Jekyll v1.3.0's command-line
interface. Follow the docs you see for the importer you'd like to use and run
the Ruby shell command as seen there (with your own tweaks, of course).

Please [file any bugs you encounter!]({{ site.repository }}/issues/new)
